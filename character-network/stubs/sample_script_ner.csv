viserys,"Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

viserys,When will they be married?,1,[set()]
illyrio,Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.,1,"[set(), set()]"
viserys,Is it true they lie with their horses?,1,[set()]
illyrio,I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.,1,[{'khal'}]
viserys,Do you take me for a fool?,1,[set()]
illyrio,I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.,1,"[set(), set(), set()]"
viserys,I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.,1,"[{'drogo'}, set()]"
daenerys targaryen,I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.,1,"[set(), set()]"
viserys,"So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?",1,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,I don't know.,1,[set()]

sansa stark,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?,1,"[set(), set()]"
catelyn stark,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.,1,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.,1,"[set(), set()]"
catelyn stark,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.,1,"[set(), set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.",1,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.,1,[{'eddard'}]
tyrion lannister,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.",1,"[{'stark'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

jon snow,Why do you read so much?,2,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Look at me and tell me what you see.,2,[set()]
jon snow,Is this a trick?,2,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.",2,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,Until your brother killed that King.,2,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.

jhiqui,It is known.,2,[set()]
doreah,A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.,2,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,The moon?,2,[set()]
doreah,"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire.",2,"[{'khaleesi'}, set(), set()]"
irri,Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.,2,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?,2,"[set(), set()]"
doreah,"Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy.",2,"[set(), set()]"

daenerys targaryen,Will it take three years?,2,[set()]

benjen stark,Welcome.,2,[set()]
catelyn stark,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.,2,"[set(), {'bran'}, set()]"
maester luwin,The boy was always sure-footed before.,2,[set()]
catelyn stark,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.,2,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
theon greyjoy,"Saw what, my lady?",2,[set()]
catelyn stark,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.,2,"[set(), set(), set()]"
rodrick cassel,"Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him.",2,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"

theon greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you.",2,[set()]
maester luwin,"What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this.",2,"[set(), set(), set(), {'stark'}]"

robb stark,"Mother, you can't.",2,[set()]
catelyn stark,I must.,2,[set()]
rodrick cassel,I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.,2,[{'hal'}]
catelyn stark,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.,2,"[set(), set()]"
rodrick cassel,Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.,2,"[set(), set()]"
robb stark,What about Bran?,2,[{'bran'}]
catelyn stark,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.,2,"[set(), {'bran'}]"

daenerys targaryen,Finish a man?,2,[set()]
doreah,Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.,2,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.",2,"[set(), {'drogo'}]"
doreah,"You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you.",2,"[{'khaleesi'}, set(), set(), {'khaleesi'}, set(), {'khaleesi'}, {'khal'}]"

sandor clegane,He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.,2,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,"He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog.

arya stark,I'm sorry.,2,[set()]
eddard stark,Are you hurt?,2,[set()]
arya stark,No.,2,[set()]
eddard stark,It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?,2,"[set(), set(), set()]"

robert baratheon,"Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly.",2,"[set(), {'ned'}, set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.,2,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.,2,"[set(), set(), set(), {'mycah'}]"
cersei lannister,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.,2,"[{'joffrey'}, set()]"

joffrey lannister,Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.,2,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,Liar!,2,[set()]
joffrey lannister,Shut up!,2,[set()]

cersei lannister,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.,2,[{'joffrey'}]
robert baratheon,You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.,2,"[set(), set(), set()]"
eddard stark,"Gladly, your Grace.",2,[set()]
cersei lannister,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?,2,"[set(), set()]"
robert baratheon,I'd forgot the damned wolf.,2,[set()]

robert baratheon,So be it.,2,[set()]
cersei lannister,We have another wolf.,2,[set()]
robert baratheon,As you will.,2,[set()]

eddard stark,Glad to see you're protecting the throne.,3,[set()]
jaime lannister,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
eddard stark,Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.,3,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.",3,"[set(), set()]"
eddard stark,You've chosen your opponents wisely then.,3,[set()]
jaime lannister,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
eddard stark,But you just stood there and watched.,3,[set()]
jaime lannister,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), {'stark'}, set(), set(), set(), {'the'}, set()]"
eddard stark,Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?,3,"[set(), set(), {'aerys'}]"
jaime lannister,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?",3,"[set(), {'the'}]"

varys,Lord Stark.,3,[{'stark'}]

renly baratheon,"And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but...",3,"[set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.",3,"[set(), {'stark'}, {'catelyn'}]"
eddard stark,"She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.",3,"[{'baelish'}, {'brandon'}]"
petyr baelish,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.,3,"[set(), set()]"
eddard stark,Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.,3,[set()]
petyr baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.",3,"[set(), {'catelyn'}, set()]"
grand maester pycelle,"I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.",3,[{'stark'}]
eddard stark,Grand Maester.,3,[set()]
grand maester pycelle,How many years has it been? You were a young man.,3,"[set(), set()]"
eddard stark,And you served another King.,3,[set()]
grand maester pycelle,"How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?",3,"[set(), set(), set()]"
eddard stark,Without the King?,3,[set()]
renly baratheon,"Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.",3,[set()]
varys,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.,3,"[{'his'}, set()]"
petyr baelish,We are the lords of small matters here.,3,[set()]
renly baratheon,My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.,3,[{'stark'}]
petyr baelish,"Mmm, how much?",3,[{'mmm'}]
eddard stark,"40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer.",3,[set()]
grand maester pycelle,Can the treasury bear such expense?,3,[set()]
petyr baelish,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?",3,"[set(), set(), {'tywin'}, set()]"
eddard stark,Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?,3,[set()]
petyr baelish,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.,3,[set()]
eddard stark,How could you let this happen?,3,[set()]
petyr baelish,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.,3,"[{'the'}, set()]"
eddard stark,I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.,3,"[{'jon', 'robert'}]"
grand maester pycelle,"Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen.",3,[{'arryn'}]
renly baratheon,"Counting coppers,"" he calls it.",3,[set()]
eddard stark,I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.,3,"[set(), set()]"

eddard stark,"There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride.",3,"[{'robert'}, set(), set()]"
varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.",3,[{'stark'}]
cersei lannister,"Please, it's nearly healed.",3,[set()]
joffrey lannister,It's ugly.,3,[set()]
cersei lannister,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.",3,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,"I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), {'stark'}]"
cersei lannister,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), {'aerys'}, set()]"
joffrey lannister,Do I have to marry her?,3,[set()]
cersei lannister,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'stark'}]"
joffrey lannister,I don't want to.,3,[set()]
cersei lannister,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.",3,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.,3,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,How would you handle them?,3,[set()]
joffrey lannister,"I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army.",3,[set()]
cersei lannister,A royal army?,3,[set()]
joffrey lannister,"Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,And if the northerners rebel?,3,[set()]
joffrey lannister,"I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe.",3,"[set(), set(), {'kevan'}]"
cersei lannister,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?",3,[set()]
joffrey lannister,For me. I'm their King.,3,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.",3,[set()]
joffrey lannister,I'm not asking.,3,[set()]
cersei lannister,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,So you agree... The Starks are enemies?,3,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.,3,[set()]
septa mordane,"Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food.",3,"[set(), set()]"

septa mordane,Enough!,3,[set()]
eddard stark,What's happening here?,3,[set()]
septa mordane,Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.,3,[{'arya'}]
eddard stark,"Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…",3,"[set(), set(), set()]"
eddard stark,The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?,3,"[{'myrcella'}, set()]"
sansa stark,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?,3,"[set(), set()]"
septa mordane,You've barely eaten a thing.,3,[set()]
eddard stark,It's all right. Go on.,3,"[set(), set()]"
eddard stark,War was easier than daughters.,3,[set()]
arya stark,Go away!,3,[set()]
eddard stark,"Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?",3,"[{'arya'}, set(), set()]"
arya stark,Mine.,3,[set()]
eddard stark,Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.,3,"[set(), set(), {'mikken'}, set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.,3,"[set(), set()]"
eddard stark,Come here. Now what do you want with this?,3,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,It's called Needle.,3,[set()]
eddard stark,A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?,3,"[set(), {'needle'}, set(), set()]"
arya stark,Stick 'em with the pointy end.,3,[set()]
eddard stark,laughs] That's the essence of it.,3,[set()]
arya stark,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.,3,"[set(), {'mycah'}, set(), set()]"
eddard stark,"No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy.",3,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.",3,"[set(), set(), {'sansa', 'the', 'joffrey'}]"
eddard stark,Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.,3,[{'sansa'}]
arya stark,So was I! He is a liar.,3,"[set(), set()]"
eddard stark,"Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong.",3,"[{'darling'}, {'sansa', 'joffrey'}, set(), set()]"
arya stark,But how you can let her marry someone like that?,3,[set()]
eddard stark,Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.,3,"[set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,Winter is coming.,3,[set()]
eddard stark,"You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'sansa'}]"
arya stark,I don't hate her. Not really.,3,"[set(), set()]"
eddard stark,"I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,I can keep it?,3,[set()]
eddard stark,"Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it.",3,"[set(), set()]"
old nan,Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.,3,"[set(), set(), set()]"
bran stark,I hate your stories.,3,[set()]
old nan,I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.,3,"[set(), {'duncan'}, set()]"
bran stark,Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.,3,"[set(), set()]"
old nan,"Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
robb stark,What are you telling him now?,3,[set()]
old nan,Only what the little Lord wants to hear.,3,[set()]

bran stark,Maybe we do.,3,[set()]
robb stark,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

petyr baelish,A dear friend told me.,3,[set()]

varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.,3,"[set(), set()]"
catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming?,3,[set()]
varys,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
catelyn stark,Do you know whose dagger this is?,3,[set()]
varys,I must admit I do not.,3,[set()]
petyr baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.",3,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
catelyn stark,Yours?,3,[set()]
petyr baelish,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.",3,"[{'joffrey'}, {'ser'}, {'the'}]"
catelyn stark,To whom?,3,[set()]
petyr baelish,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.,3,"[{'tyrion'}, {'the'}]"

alliser thorne,Next!,3,[set()]

eddard stark,My wife is in Winterfell.,3,[set()]

jon snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are.,3,[set()]
tyrion lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.,3,"[{'ser'}, set(), {'bran'}, set()]"
petyr baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.,3,[set()]
catelyn stark,We have proof. We have the blade.,3,"[set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.",3,"[{'tyrion'}, set()]"

jaime lannister,Calm down.,3,[set()]
cersei lannister,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?,3,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?,3,"[set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.,3,"[set(), set(), set()]"

He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.

yoren,"Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours.

cersei lannister,Is my father wrong?,5,[set()]
robert baratheon,"Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children.

robert baratheon,"Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King.

cersei lannister,What do you want?,5,[set()]
robert baratheon,"We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together.",5,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Our marriage.,5,[set()]

cersei lannister,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?",5,"[set(), set()]"
robert baratheon,"You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?",5,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.",5,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

eddard stark,How many?,5,[set()]

eddard stark,And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?,5,"[{'jon'}, set()]"

Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha.

He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man.

tyrion lannister,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.,13,"[{'theon', 'starks'}, {'greyjoy'}]"

petyr baelish,Tell no one what?,13,[set()]

petyr baelish,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?",13,"[{'lysa'}, set()]"

The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace.

bronn,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.",19,"[set(), set(), set()]"
prostitute,Oh.,19,[set()]
bronn,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.,19,"[set(), set(), set()]"

bronn,I don't think he likes me.,19,[set()]
sandor clegane,You think you're a hard man?,19,[set()]
bronn,I know it.,19,[set()]
bronn,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.,19,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sandor clegane,"Oh, there's women in the ground. I put some there myself. So have you. You like fucking and drinking and singing. But killing, killing's the thing you love. You're just like me.",19,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,"Oddly enough, I do.",19,[set()]
varys,Good.,19,[set()]
varys,The map you asked for.,19,[set()]
tyrion lannister,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.,19,[set()]
varys,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.,19,"[set(), {'targaryens'}]"
tyrion lannister,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.",19,"[set(), set()]"

varys,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.,19,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.",19,"[set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,"No, I don't believe you have.",19,[set()]
varys,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door.

joffrey lannister,A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.,19,[set()]

joffrey lannister,"If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought.",19,[{'hound'}]
tyrion lannister,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too.

cersei lannister,So? I didn't offer you water.,19,"[set(), set()]"

tywin lannister,You brought a whore into my bed.,21,[set()]
tyrion lannister,It wasn't your bed at the time.,21,[set()]
tywin lannister,"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.",21,"[set(), set(), set()]"

tywin lannister,"What do you want, Tyrion?",21,[{'tyrion'}]
tyrion lannister,Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.,21,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.,21,[{'pycelle'}]
tyrion lannister,"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.

tyrion lannister,Why?,21,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.

shae,Why Dorne?,21,[{'dorne'}]
sansa stark,It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back.

joffrey lannister,Who?,22,[set()]
cersei lannister,Margaery.,22,[{'margaery'}]
joffrey lannister,"She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.",22,"[set(), {'tyrells'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.",22,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,"Yes, she is.",22,[set()]
cersei lannister,Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.,22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,Not to me.,22,[set()]
cersei lannister,I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.,22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.,22,[set()]
cersei lannister,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.,22,"[{'margaery'}, set(), {'renly'}]"
joffrey lannister,She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.,22,"[{'renly'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,You need to ask yourself,22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,I don't need to do anything.,22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,Better. Much better.,22,"[set(), set()]"
shae,I still don't believe it.,22,[set()]
sansa stark,He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.,22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
shae,Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.,22,[set()]
sansa stark,Littlefinger's not in love with me.,22,[{'littlefinger'}]
shae,Love is not the thing he wants.,22,[set()]
sansa stark,He's too old.,22,[set()]
shae,They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or...?,22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,No.,22,[set()]
shae,"If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.",22,[set()]
sansa stark,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.,22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
guard,"Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.",22,[{'loras'}]
sansa stark,Send him in.,22,[set()]
loras,Lady Sansa.,22,[{'sansa'}]
sansa stark,Ser Loras.,22,[{'ser'}]
loras,"My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens. May I escort you to them?",22,"[{'margaery', 'olenna'}, set()]"
loras,"I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.",22,[{'sansa'}]
sansa stark,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose.",22,"[{'loras'}, set(), {'hando'}, set()]"
loras,Of course I did.,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,It's more your color. You take it.,22,"[set(), set()]"
maid,Thank you.,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,You're such a dear.,22,[set()]
loras,I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.,22,"[set(), {'sansa'}]"
sansa stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras.",22,[{'ser'}]
margaery tyrell,"Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.",22,"[set(), {'sansa', 'tyrell', 'olenna'}]"
olenna tyrell,"Kiss me, child.",22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.,22,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.",22,"[{'renly', 'margaery'}, set()]"
olenna tyrell,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.",22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,"Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras.",22,"[{'renly'}, {'loras', 'father'}]"
olenna tyrell,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-,22,"[{'loras'}, set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?,22,"[set(), {'sansa'}]"
olenna tyrell,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'renly', 'robert'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), {'sansa'}, set()]"
sansa stark,Lemon cake's my favorite.,22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.",22,"[set(), set(), {'sansa'}, set()]"
olenna tyrell,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?,22,"[set(), {'the'}]"
sansa stark,I haven't had the pleasure.,22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.",22,"[set(), set(), set(), {'luthor'}, set(), set(), set(), {'joffrey'}]"
sansa stark,"I-, I-",22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,Has he ripped out your tongue?,22,[set()]
sansa stark,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion",22,"[{'his', 'joffrey'}]"
olenna tyrell,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.,22,"[set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,Bring me some cheese.,22,[set()]
servant,"The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.",22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.,22,"[set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,My father always told the truth.,22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.",22,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.,22,"[{'joffrey'}, {'joffrey'}, set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,Go on.,22,[set()]
sansa stark,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.,22,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,"She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her.",22,"[set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.",22,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,He's a monster.,22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,Ah. That's a pity.,22,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,"Please, don't stop the wedding.",22,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.",22,"[set(), {'margaery', 'oaf'}, set(), set()]"
rickard karstark,We're at war. This march is a distraction.,22,"[set(), set()]"
robb stark,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.,22,[set()]
rickard karstark,Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?,22,[set()]
rickard karstark,Then it's a distraction.,22,[set()]
robb stark,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.,22,"[{'edmure'}, set()]"
rickard karstark,"Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference.",22,[set()]

rickard karstark,"If it's revenge, I still got faith in it.",22,[set()]
robb stark,If you no longer believe-,22,[set()]

rickard karstark,"May I speak my mind, Your Grace?",22,[set()]
robb stark,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?",22,[{'karstark'}]

catelyn stark,No.,22,[set()]
talisa,"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-",22,[set()]
catelyn stark,You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.,22,"[set(), set()]"
talisa,You've made them before?,22,[set()]
catelyn stark,Twice.,22,[set()]
talisa,Did they work?,22,[set()]
catelyn stark,After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.,22,"[set(), {'bran'}]"
catelyn stark,"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night.

talisa,Which boy?,22,[set()]
catelyn stark,"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.",22,"[{'jon'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'stark'}]"
talisa,And he lived.,22,[set()]
catelyn stark,And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.,22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
mance,Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?,22,[{'halfhand'}]
jon snow,Yes.,22,[set()]
mance,"You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I understand.,22,[set()]
mance,"Well, how could you understand?",22,[set()]
jon snow,You want to protect your people.,22,[set()]
mance,"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?",22,"[set(), set(), {'thenns', 'hornfoots'}, {'hornfoots'}, set(), set()]"

tormund,Shouldn't be long now.,22,[set()]

gendry baratheon,Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.,22,[{'jaqen'}]
arya stark,I'm not listening.,22,[set()]
gendry baratheon,But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.,22,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'joffrey'}]"

gendry baratheon,You could have picked Tywin Lannister.,22,[{'tywin'}]

arya stark,What friends?,22,[set()]
anguy,The fat to your left and the lad beside him.,22,[set()]

thoros,Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.,22,"[{'thoros'}, {'anguy'}]"

thoros,The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.,22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
hot pie,I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.,22,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
thoros,"You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way.",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

shae,My lion.,22,[set()]
tyrion lannister,We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.,22,"[set(), set()]"
shae,But you said I should come to you with any problems.,22,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Did anyone see you? No.,22,"[set(), set()]"
shae,No.,22,[set()]
tyrion lannister,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.,22,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,All right. What is this problem?,22,"[set(), set()]"
shae,"I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.",22,"[{'sansa'}, {'baelish'}]"

shae,I don't know her name.,22,[set()]

shae,How do you know her?,22,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.,22,"[set(), set()]"
shae,She's a whore.,22,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.",22,[set()]
shae,You fucked her.,22,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.",22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.",22,[set()]
shae,And was she good? Did you like her?,22,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?",22,"[set(), {'littlefinger'}]"
shae,That Sansa shouldn't trust him.,22,[{'sansa'}]
tyrion lannister,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?,22,[{'littlefinger'}]
shae,We have to protect her.,22,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.",22,"[set(), {'sansa'}, set()]"
shae,"A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?",22,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
shae,You pervert. You want her? This child?,22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I don't even want to talk about her.,22,[set()]

tyrion lannister,Only because you're making me.,22,[set()]

tyrion lannister,"Hmm, yes.",22,[set()]

joffrey lannister,Send her in.,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,"You wanted to see me, Your Grace?",22,[{'your'}]
joffrey lannister,I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.,22,"[set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,"That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want.",22,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.,22,"[set(), set(), set(), {'renly'}]"
margaery tyrell,A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.,22,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?,22,"[set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,"Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.",22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.,22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,You failed to do this.,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,"Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace.",22,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.,22,"[set(), set(), set(), {'renly'}]"
joffrey lannister,What makes you say this?,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,"Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me.",22,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,"No, he was a known degenerate.",22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,"It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.",22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.,22,"[{'mmm'}, set()]"
margaery tyrell,As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.,22,"[set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,You are the king.,22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,Yes. I am.,22,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.,22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
margaery tyrell,It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?,22,"[set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.,22,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,The bolt goes here.,22,[set()]
joffrey lannister,And then you just aim and-,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,"Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman.",22,"[set(), set(), set()]"
joffrey lannister,It's not unheard of.,22,[set()]
margaery tyrell,My father would never let me before-,22,[set()]

jaime lannister,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.,22,[set()]

jaime lannister,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.,22,"[set(), set()]"

jaime lannister,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.,22,[set()]

brynden,You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.,23,"[set(), set()]"

robb stark,It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.,23,"[set(), set()]"
edmure,I seized an opportunity.,23,[set()]
robb stark,What value was the mill?,23,[set()]
edmure,The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.,23,[set()]
robb stark,Is he there now? Of course not.,23,"[set(), set()]"
edmure,We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.,23,"[set(), set()]"
robb stark,"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him.

tywin lannister,What news of Jaime?,23,[{'jaime'}]
tywin lannister,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?",23,"[set(), set(), set()]"
varys,"We are trying, my lord.",23,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Try harder. What do we have, then?",23,"[set(), set()]"
varys,"Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.",23,"[{'hoster', 'robb'}, {'stark', 'harrenhal', 'roose'}]"

petyr baelish,Titles do seem to breed titles.,23,[set()]
tywin lannister,You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.,23,"[{'lysa', 'eyrie'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory.

tywin lannister,Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.,23,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,Master of Coin?,23,[{'master'}]
tywin lannister,It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.,23,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.",23,[set()]
cersei lannister,I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.,23,[set()]
pycelle,"Hear, hear.",23,[set()]
men,"He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there.

brienne,And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.,23,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,You were not beating me.,23,[set()]
brienne,Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.,23,"[set(), set()]"

jaime lannister,They'll knock your teeth out.,23,[set()]
brienne,You think I care about my teeth?,23,[set()]
jaime lannister,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?",23,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
brienne,What does it matter?,23,[set()]
jaime lannister,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.,23,"[set(), {'renly'}]"

thoros,"You're not our prisoner, little lady.",23,[set()]
arya stark,What am I?,23,[set()]
thoros,Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.,23,"[set(), set()]"

sandor clegane,"You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?",23,[set()]
anguy,Better than anyone you've ever met.,23,[set()]

bronn,But what if I don't?,23,[set()]

He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.

I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed.

jaime lannister,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it?

jaime lannister,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.'

tyrion lannister,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?,25,"[{'tyrell'}, set()]"
tywin lannister,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.,25,"[set(), set(), set(), {'joffrey', 'tyrells'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,And how do we do that?,25,[set()]
tywin lannister,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.,25,[{'sansa'}]

tywin lannister,I can and I do.,25,[set()]

tyrion lannister,And if I refuse?,25,[set()]
tywin lannister,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.,25,"[set(), {'sansa'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,I was wed. Or don't you remember?,25,[set()]
tywin lannister,Only too well.,25,[set()]

So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew.

tywin lannister,Old?,26,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.",26,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?",26,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.",26,"[set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.,26,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?",26,"[{'tywin'}, set()]"
tywin lannister,Of course.,26,[set()]

tywin lannister,No.,26,[set()]
olenna tyrell,Not once? Not in any way?,26,"[set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,Never.,26,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.",26,"[set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.,26,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.",26,"[set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.,26,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.",26,"[set(), {'tyrells'}]"
tywin lannister,I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.,26,"[set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree.",26,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.",26,[{'joffrey'}]
olenna tyrell,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.",26,"[{'cersei', 'loras'}, set()]"
tywin lannister,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.,26,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.",26,"[{'cersei', 'loras'}, set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,Oh,26,[set()]
tywin lannister,The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.,26,"[{'tyrell'}, {'margaery', 'joffrey'}]"
olenna tyrell,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?,26,[set()]
tywin lannister,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?",26,"[set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.,26,[set()]
orell,No!,26,[set()]

tormund,No!,26,[set()]
jon snow,Take my hand!,26,[set()]

sansa stark,I'm very happy about,26,[set()]
loras,"Uh, yes. I-I am as well.",26,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,I feel like I'm in a dream.,26,[set()]
loras,"Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?",26,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.,26,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
loras,"It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.",26,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.,26,[set()]
cersei lannister,We can have them both killed.,26,[set()]
tyrion lannister,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.,26,"[set(), {'sansa'}, {'loras'}]"
cersei lannister,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.,26,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,On a boat you built.,26,[set()]
cersei lannister,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.,26,"[{'tyrells'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.,26,"[set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.",26,"[set(), {'stannis'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?,26,"[set(), set(), {'mandon'}]"
tyrion lannister,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.",26,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'the'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,What do you want me to say?,26,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.,26,[set()]
cersei lannister,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.,26,"[set(), {'joffrey'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.,26,[{'tywin'}]
cersei lannister,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.",26,"[{'tyrells'}, set(), {'margaery', 'joffrey'}, set(), set()]"

cersei lannister,Who's going to tell her?,26,[set()]
sansa stark,Do you think people will like it?,26,[set()]
shae,I don't think they will even notice it.,26,[set()]
sansa stark,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.",26,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'loras'}]"
shae,I'm sure he does.,26,[set()]
sansa stark,Will they let me invite my family?,26,[set()]

petyr baelish,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.",26,"[set(), {'sansa', 'tyrells'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
varys,I did what I did for the good of the realm.,26,[set()]

varys,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.,26,"[set(), set(), set()]"

petyr baelish,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.,26,"[set(), set()]"

barristan,"Two thousand, Your Grace. Armored and mounted.",28,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Enough to make a difference?,28,[set()]

daenerys targaryen,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.,28,[{'the'}]

stannis baratheon,So did Renly.,28,[{'renly'}]

davos,"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die.

daario,They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.,28,"[set(), set(), set(), {'daario'}, set(), set()]"

gilly,I doubt it.,28,[set()]

gilly,A what?,28,[set()]
sam,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference.",28,[set()]
gilly,A wink is on purpose.,28,[set()]

gilly,Mormont.,28,[set()]
sam,"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.",28,[set()]
gilly,Why is it a last name?,28,[set()]

tywin lannister,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.,30,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,So that's why you did it? To save lives?,30,"[set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.,30,"[set(), set()]"

When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry.",30,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

walder frey,Oh. And?,30,"[set(), set()]"
roose bolton,Ramsay delivered the terms. The Ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would. They handed him over trussed and hooded. But Ramsay- well Ramsay has his own way of doing things.,30,"[{'ramsay'}, {'theon'}, set(), {'ramsay'}]"

varys,"Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense.

tywin lannister,I'm not trying to trick you.,33,[set()]
tommen lannister,It means I'll become king.,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?",33,"[set(), set()]"
tommen lannister,A good king?,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?",33,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,This is hardly the place or the time.,33,[set()]
tommen lannister,Holiness?,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.,33,"[set(), {'baelor'}, set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tommen lannister,Justice.,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?,33,"[set(), set(), {'orys'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tommen lannister,No.,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,No.,33,[set()]
tommen lannister,What about strength?,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?",33,"[set(), set(), {'robert'}, {'targaryen'}, set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tommen lannister,Wisdom.,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,Yes!,33,[set()]
tommen lannister,Wisdom is what makes a good king.,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?,33,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tywin lannister,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",33,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tommen lannister,A king needs a queen.,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?",33,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tommen lannister,Yes.,33,[set()]
tywin lannister,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?",33,[set()]
tommen lannister,I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.,33,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,How are you?,33,[set()]
tommen lannister,I'm all right.,33,[set()]
jaime lannister,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.,33,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.,33,[set()]
septon,"Yes, my lord. All of you.",33,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...",33,"[{'tyrion'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'joff'}]"
jaime lannister,I don't know what I saw.,33,[set()]
cersei lannister,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.,33,"[set(), set(), {'tyrion'}]"
jaime lannister,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.,33,"[{'tyrion'}, set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.",33,"[set(), set(), set(), {'jaime'}, set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?,33,"[set(), set()]"

cersei lannister,Stop. Stop. It's not right.,33,"[set(), set(), set()]"

sandor clegane,"If I'm standing on it, it's my land.",33,[set()]
arya stark,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.,33,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,He's never been the same.,33,[set()]
farmer hamlet,Which house did he fight for?,33,[set()]
arya stark,The Tullys of Riverrun.,33,[{'the'}]
farmer hamlet,"There's a storm coming. You'll be wanting a roof tonight. There's fresh hay in the barn. And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do. We don't have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.",33,"[set(), set(), set(), {'sally'}, set()]"
farmer hamlet,We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty. We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door. We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil. We ask the Maiden to protect Sally's virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity.,33,"[set(), set(), set(), {'sally'}]"

farmer hamlet,The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.,33,"[set(), {'walder'}, {'starks'}, set()]"
sandor clegane,Guest right don't mean much anymore.,33,[set()]
farmer hamlet,"It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour.",33,"[set(), set(), {'frey'}, {'hoster'}, set(), set(), set(), {'sally'}, set()]"
sandor clegane,You got any ale?,33,[set()]
farmer hamlet,Afraid not.,33,[set()]
sandor clegane,How can a man not keep ale in his home?,33,[set()]
farmer hamlet,"You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense.",33,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'sally'}, set(), set()]"

arya stark,You don't know that.,33,[set()]
sandor clegane,I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.,33,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.,33,[set()]
sandor clegane,There's plenty worse than me. I just understand the way things are. How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?,33,"[set(), set(), set()]"

tywin lannister,When will the wedding take place in your mind?,35,[set()]
cersei lannister,As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.,35,"[set(), {'tommen', 'margaery'}]"
tywin lannister,A fortnight?,35,[set()]
cersei lannister,That seems reasonable.,35,[set()]
tywin lannister,"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals.",35,[set()]
tywin lannister,And your wedding to Loras?,35,[{'loras'}]
cersei lannister,Shortly after Tommen's.,35,[{'tommen'}]
tywin lannister,Shortly?,35,[set()]
cersei lannister,A fortnight.,35,[set()]
tywin lannister,I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.,35,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,We had that in common.,35,[set()]
tywin lannister,You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.,35,[set()]

tywin lannister,Ourselves alone.,35,[set()]
tywin lannister,The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.,35,[{'tyrells'}]
cersei lannister,Robert wasn't particularly rich.,35,[{'robert'}]
tywin lannister,Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.,35,"[{'robert'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.,35,[set()]

tywin lannister,Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.,35,[set()]
cersei lannister,Then how do we pay for anything?,35,[set()]
tywin lannister,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.,35,[set()]

tywin lannister,A tremendous amount.,35,[set()]
cersei lannister,"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.",35,[set()]

tywin lannister,How do you know him?,36,[set()]

jaime lannister,You fell in love with a whore.,37,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son.

tyrion lannister,And you understand the rules of inheritance?,37,[set()]
bronn,Falyse is forty and barren.,37,[{'falyse'}]
tyrion lannister,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.,37,[set()]
bronn,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.,37,"[set(), set(), {'lollys'}]"
bronn,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.,37,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?,37,"[set(), set()]"
bronn,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.",37,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Is it two wives you want or two castles?,37,[set()]
bronn,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.",37,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.,37,"[set(), set()]"
bronn,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?,37,"[set(), set()]"

bronn,"Your sister's a Lannister, too.",37,[{'lannister'}]

bronn,"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.",37,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'mountain', 'lollys'}]"
tyrion lannister,Does he frighten you so much?,37,[set()]
bronn,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?",37,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,I understand.,37,[set()]
bronn,I'm sorry it has to be this way.,37,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.,37,"[set(), set(), set()]"
bronn,We had some good days together.,37,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes, we did.",37,[set()]
bronn,What will you do?,37,[set()]

daario,My sword is yours till the day I die.,37,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?,37,[set()]

selyse,It was. I- humor isn't my strength.,37,"[set(), set()]"
melisandre,That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.,37,[set()]
selyse,"If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?",37,[set()]
melisandre,Not always.,37,[set()]
melisandre,"Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lordo s power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust.",37,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
selyse,Did you use it with Stannis?,37,[{'stannis'}]
melisandre,No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.,37,"[set(), set(), set()]"
melisandre,It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.,37,"[set(), set()]"
selyse,"No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us.

daenerys targaryen,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?,37,[set()]
jorah mormont,I did.,37,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I trust you.,37,[set()]

jorah mormont,You have?,37,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I have.,37,[set()]
jorah mormont,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.",37,[{'khaleesi'}]
daenerys targaryen,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands.

jorah mormont,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.",37,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?,37,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"

Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy.

brienne,The quick version.,37,[set()]
hot pie,The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner.

oberyn martell,Your sister.,37,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Oh.,37,[set()]

tyrion lannister,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,37,[set()]
oberyn martell,It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.,37,"[set(), {'lannister'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.,37,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
oberyn martell,"Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago.",37,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I think I would have remembered that.,37,[set()]
oberyn martell,"Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock.

tyrion lannister,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,37,[set()]
oberyn martell,"The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.",37,"[{'tywin'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,That would have made things so much easier.,37,[set()]
oberyn martell,"When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon.

oberyn martell,"I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here.

aemon,Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you.

I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word.

I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate.

jaqen hghar,A lie.,46,[set()]
arya stark,After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.,46,"[set(), set(), set()]"

jorah mormont,Do you ever shut up?,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.,46,"[set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,Why?,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.,46,"[set(), {'tyrion'}]"
jorah mormont,I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.,46,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.",46,[{'mormont'}]
jorah mormont,What do you know about my father?,46,[set()]

tyrion lannister,You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.,46,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,How?,46,[set()]

tyrion lannister,I believe in many things.,46,[set()]

tyrion lannister,No.,46,[set()]
jorah mormont,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?",46,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'daenerys'}, set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,It's hard to be a cynic after that.,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.,46,[set()]
jorah mormont,No it doesn't.,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?",46,"[{'targaryens'}, set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,First we have to conquer the world.,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?",46,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,Then she rules.,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?,46,"[set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,She is the rightful heir.,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?",46,[set()]
jorah mormont,Shh! It's a slave ship,46,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,Why is it anchored?,46,[set()]
jorah mormont,They probably came ashore for--,46,[set()]
malko,water.,46,[set()]
sam tarly,PLACE - LATER,46,[set()]
malko,"Got a lot of fight in you, huh?",46,[set()]
slaver,Salt mines.,46,[set()]

slaver,What about the dwarf?,46,[set()]
malko,Worthless. Cut his throat.,46,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!",46,"[set(), set()]"
malko,And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf's cock has magic powers.,46,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?",46,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
slaver,It will be a dwarf-sized cock.,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Guess again.,46,[set()]
malko,The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant.,46,[set()]
jorah mormont,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.,46,[{'daenerys'}]
malko,"We're bound to Volantis, not Slaver's Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits.",46,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.",46,"[{'mereen'}, set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,Him.,46,[set()]
malko,Him? He's got to be 60 years old.,46,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!",46,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
malko,Is that true?,46,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.",46,[{'jaime'}]
tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer!,46,[{'the'}]
malko,Jousting. You're talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole.,46,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.,46,[set()]
malko,Liar.,46,[set()]
jorah mormont,"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth.",46,"[set(), {'qotho'}, {'khal'}, set()]"

petyr baelish,Well done.,46,[set()]
petyr baelish,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?,46,"[set(), set()]"
lancel,"Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You'll find that there's little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.",46,"[{'baelish'}, set()]"
petyr baelish,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.",46,"[{'lancel'}, set()]"
petyr baelish,"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?",46,[set()]
cersei lannister,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.,46,[{'highgarden'}]
petyr baelish,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.,46,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?,46,"[set(), {'ser'}]"
petyr baelish,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.,46,[{'tyrell'}]
cersei lannister,"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.",46,"[{'tyrell'}, {'baelish'}, {'ser'}]"
petyr baelish,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.,46,[set()]
cersei lannister,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.,46,"[set(), {'lysa'}, set(), set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.,46,"[{'lysa'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.",46,"[set(), set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.,46,[set()]
cersei lannister,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?,46,[{'the'}]
petyr baelish,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.,46,"[{'robyn'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,Good. If there's nothing else.,46,"[set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.",46,"[set(), set(), {'arya'}, set(), {'sansa'}, set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,That's not possible.,46,[set()]
petyr baelish,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.",46,"[set(), {'tommen', 'roose', 'ramsay'}]"
cersei lannister,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.,46,[{'roose'}]
petyr baelish,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.,46,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,We were fools to trust a turncloak.,46,[set()]
petyr baelish,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.,46,[set()]
cersei lannister,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.,46,[set()]
petyr baelish,"I would counsel patience, your grace.",46,[set()]
cersei lannister,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.",46,"[set(), {'sansa', 'roose'}]"
petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.",46,"[{'stannis'}, {'stannis', 'roose'}]"
cersei lannister,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.",46,"[set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.",46,"[set(), {'kevan'}]"
cersei lannister,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.,46,[{'kevan'}]
petyr baelish,"Ser Jaime, then.",46,[{'ser'}]
cersei lannister,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.,46,"[{'jaime'}, set()]"
petyr baelish,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.",46,"[set(), {'the'}]"
cersei lannister,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.",46,[{'baelish'}]
petyr baelish,"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?",46,"[{'lannister'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,And if you succeed?,46,[set()]
petyr baelish,Name me Warden of the North.,46,[set()]
cersei lannister,I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.,46,"[set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.,46,[set()]
cersei lannister,And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.,46,[{'sansa'}]

trystane,I'm going to ask him tomorrow.,46,[set()]

olenna tyrell,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.,46,[{'loras'}]
cersei lannister,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?,46,"[{'ser'}, set(), set()]"

olenna tyrell,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.,46,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial.

loras,He was my friend. He was my king.,46,"[set(), set()]"
sparrow,"Wasn't Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly.",46,"[{'joffrey'}, {'renly'}]"
loras,I was wrong to support Renly's claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.,46,"[{'renly'}, set(), {'joffrey'}, set()]"
sparrow,Wearing Renly's armor.,46,[{'renly'}]
loras,Why does it matter what I wore?,46,[set()]

loras,Never.,46,[set()]

margaery tyrell,They are lies.,46,[set()]

margaery tyrell,All of them.,46,[set()]
sparrow,"Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?",46,[{'margaery'}]
margaery tyrell,"Yes, I swear it.",46,[set()]

olyvar,I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.,46,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sparrow,And what occurred in his chamber?,46,[set()]
olyvar,We engaged in intimate relations.,46,[set()]

loras,Liar! He's a liar!,46,"[set(), set()]"

olyvar,"Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn't seem surprised.",46,"[{'margaery'}, set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?,46,"[set(), {'highgarden'}]"
olyvar,"He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne.",46,"[set(), {'dorne'}]"

They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that.

daenerys targaryen,So I should kill him?,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.",48,"[set(), set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.,48,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,And what would your father do?,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.,48,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Is that why you killed him?,48,[set()]

daenerys targaryen,I'm terrible?,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I've heard stories.,48,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.,48,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Which kind is that?,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.,48,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.,48,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.",48,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Perhaps it won't come to that.,48,[set()]

daenerys targaryen,Varys? King Robert's spy master?,48,"[set(), {'robert'}]"
tyrion lannister,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.,48,"[set(), set(), {'ser'}]"
daenerys targaryen,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.,48,"[{'jorah', 'varys'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.,48,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,But you trust him?,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.",48,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,The brother who killed my father.,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,That's the one.,48,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.,48,[set()]

tyrion lannister,No? Banish me?,48,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,No.,48,[set()]

daenerys targaryen,How to get what I want.,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.,48,"[{'the'}, set()]"
daenerys targaryen,If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.,48,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.,48,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?",48,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,The common people.,48,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells.

tormund,Gather the elders and let's talk.,48,[set()]
jon snow,My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.,48,"[{'jon'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
karsi,You built that wall to keep us out.,48,[set()]
loboda,Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?,48,[set()]
jon snow,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.,48,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
karsi,"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.",48,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.,48,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.,48,"[set(), set()]"
loboda,You saw this?,48,[set()]
jon snow,No. But I trust the man.,48,"[set(), set()]"
karsi,There are old stories about Dragonglass.,48,[{'dragonglass'}]
loboda,There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.,48,[set()]
karsi,And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?,48,[set()]
jon snow,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.,48,[set()]
karsi,Come with you where?,48,[set()]
jon snow,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.,48,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life.",48,"[{'mance'}, set(), set(), set()]"
karsi,If…?,48,[set()]
jon snow,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.,48,[set()]
loboda,Where is Mance?,48,[{'mance'}]
jon snow,He died.,48,[set()]
loboda,How?,48,[set()]
jon snow,I put an arrow through his heart.,48,[set()]
loboda,I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.,48,[set()]
tormund,"None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that's what we need today",48,"[{'mance'}, set(), {'stannis'}, {'jon'}, set(), set()]"
karsi,"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.",48,[set()]
jon snow,"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight.",48,"[set(), set(), {'mance'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
karsi,"You vouch for this man, Tormund?",48,[{'tormund'}]
tormund,"He's prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He's young, but he knows how to lead. He didn't have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him.",48,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
loboda,My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.,48,[set()]
karsi,"So would mine, but fuck 'em, they're dead.",48,[set()]
tormund,This is the way.,48,[set()]
wildling elder,I'm with Tormund. We stay here we're dead men. At least with King Crow there's a chance.,48,"[{'tormund'}, set(), {'crow'}]"

karsi,I fucking hate Thenns.,48,[{'thenns'}]
jon snow,How many are with us? 5000?,48,"[set(), set()]"
tormund,I'm not good at counting.,48,[set()]
jon snow,We're leaving too many behind.,48,[set()]
tormund,The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.,48,"[set(), {'mance'}, set()]"

margaery tyrell,"Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though.

Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son. This you getting back at me, boy? Hmm? Bring that to my table and making me dine with it.

melisandre,I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.,59,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,How do you know what he commands?,59,[set()]

jon snow,Why?,59,[set()]
melisandre,I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.,59,"[set(), set(), set()]"

melisandre,The one we've got.,59,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall.

yara greyjoy,And he paid for them.,59,[set()]

theon greyjoy,The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --,59,"[set(), set()]"

daenerys targaryen,Reasonable.,59,[set()]
tyrion lannister,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?,59,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it.

I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn.

daenerys targaryen,Forgive me --,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.",63,[{'davos'}]
daenerys targaryen,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?",63,"[{'davos'}, {'aegon', 'torren'}, {'torren', 'targaryen'}, set()]"

tyrion lannister,Forever.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.",63,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,I am not.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?",63,"[set(), set(), {'targaryen'}]"
jon snow,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.",63,"[set(), {'targaryen'}, set(), set(), set(), {'stark', 'targaryens'}, {'jon'}, set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Then why are you here?,63,[set()]
jon snow,Because I need your help and you need mine.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?,63,[set()]
jon snow,I did.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?",63,[set()]
jon snow,They're hard to miss.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"But still, I need your help?",63,[set()]
davos,"Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.",63,"[{'cersei'}, set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,Almost.,63,[set()]
jon snow,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'cersei'}]"
daenerys targaryen,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.",63,[set()]
jon snow,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.",63,[{'cersei'}]
daenerys targaryen,You told me you liked this man.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I do.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.",63,[set()]

jon snow,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?",63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think you're either of those things.",63,[set()]
jon snow,The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --,63,"[set(), {'the'}, set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,we're finished.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.,63,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.

daenerys targaryen,They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.,63,[{'the'}]
tyrion lannister,The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,whatever you saw beyond the wall.,63,[set()]
davos,You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
davos,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.",63,"[{'daenerys', 'jon'}, {'dothraki'}, {'wildlings'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"

davos,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.,63,"[{'daenerys'}, set()]"
jon snow,There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.,63,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,And why would I do that?,63,[set()]
jon snow,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,Am I your prisoner?,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Not yet.,63,[set()]
varys,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.,63,[set()]

euron greyjoy,My queen. Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.,63,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,I give you --,63,[set()]
euron greyjoy,what no other man could give. Justice. Justice for your murdered daughter.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.,63,[set()]
euron greyjoy,A bit more than a true friend.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.,63,[set()]
euron greyjoy,There's only one reward I want.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,You shall have what your heart desires --,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,when the war is won.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.",63,"[{'euron', 'jaime'}]"
euron greyjoy,"There's nothing quite like it, is there? The love of the people. I suppose you wouldn't know.",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.",63,[set()]
euron greyjoy,"Or yours. They just like severed heads really. Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers.",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Advice?,63,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Does she like it gentle or rough? A finger in the bum?,63,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,"Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now. We'll talk later.",63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.",63,"[set(), set(), {'ser'}, {'oberyn'}]"
cersei lannister,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?",63,"[set(), set(), set(), {'oberyn'}, set(), set(), set(), {'gregor'}, set(), {'ser'}, set(), set(), {'ser'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'myrcella'}, set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,It doesn't matter now.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty.",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,I imagine she is your favorite.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love.",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), {'ellaria'}, {'gregor', 'oberyn'}, set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,"She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.",63,"[set(), set()]"
tyene,Momma!,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?",63,"[{'qyburn'}, {'myrcella'}, set()]"
qyburn,The Long Farewell.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,That's the one.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,How long does the poison take?,63,[set()]
qyburn,"Difficult to say. Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution.",63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,But death is certain?,63,[set()]
qyburn,"Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain.",63,[{'your'}]
cersei lannister,"Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.,63,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,No.,63,[set()]
jaime lannister,Don't.,63,[set()]
jaime lannister,What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?,63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.,63,"[set(), set()]"
messenger,"Forgive me, Your Grace. The visitor from Braavos has arrived.",63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.,63,"[set(), set()]"
messenger,"At once, Your Grace.",63,[set()]
tycho,"No, thank you.",63,[set()]
tycho,"My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son. From all reports he was a fine young man.",63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.,63,[set()]
tycho,Condolences and congratulations. You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms. That's quite an accomplishment. The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.,63,[set()]
tycho,Indeed. But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.,63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.,63,[set()]
tycho,"Your father never minced words either. But, yes, your debts are considerable. And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts. We both know how expensive war can be.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tycho,Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies. You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.,63,"[{'tyrells'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.,63,[set()]
tycho,We don't make bets. We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.,63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tycho,Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.,63,[{'euron'}]
cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.,63,[{'euron'}]
tycho,For now. Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons. How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?,63,"[set(), {'daenerys'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?",63,"[set(), {'targaryen'}, set(), set(), {'daenerys'}]"
tycho,"The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true.",63,[set()]
cersei lannister,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?,63,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?,63,"[set(), set()]"
tycho,Your father's daughter indeed.,63,[set()]
cersei lannister,Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I'm a prisoner on this island.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.",63,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Except to my ship. They took my ship.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I wouldn't say we took your ship.,63,[set()]
jon snow,I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.",63,[set()]
jon snow,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --,63,"[set(), set(), {'the'}]"
jon snow,You probably don't believe me.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I do actually.,63,[set()]
jon snow,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",63,"[set(), set(), {'mormont'}]"
jon snow,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Good question.,63,[set()]
jon snow,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",63,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,63,[set()]
jon snow,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",63,"[set(), set(), {'daenerys'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,63,[set()]
jon snow,What do you mean?,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.,63,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Dragonglass?,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.",63,[{'jon'}]
daenerys targaryen,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?,63,[{'dragonglass'}]
tyrion lannister,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.",63,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.",63,[{'jon'}]
daenerys targaryen,Which wise man said this?,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I don't remember.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.",63,"[set(), {'jon'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?,63,"[{'ser'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.,63,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Amazing thing to see.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.,63,"[{'vicerys', 'rhaegon'}, set()]"
daenerys targaryen,You lost two brothers as well?,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.,63,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,You've been talking to Tyrion?,63,[{'tyrion'}]
daenerys targaryen,He is my Hand.,63,[set()]
jon snow,He enjoys talking.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,We all enjoy what we're good at.,63,[set()]
jon snow,I don't.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.,63,[{'cersei'}]
jon snow,I never expected that you would.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.,63,[set()]
jon snow,I haven't either.,63,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.,63,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Thank you.,63,[set()]
jon snow,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?,63,[{'the'}]
daenerys targaryen,"You better get to work, Jon Snow.",63,[{'jon'}]
sansa stark,How much do we have?,63,[set()]
wolkan,"4,000 bushels, My Lady.",63,[set()]
sansa stark,What does that mean?,63,[set()]
yohn,"For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more.",63,[set()]
sansa stark,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?,63,[set()]
wolkan,I'm not entirely certain. I'll check Maester Llewyn's records. He kept a copy of every raven scroll.,63,"[set(), {'llewyn'}, set()]"
sansa stark,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.",63,[set()]
wolkan,"No, My Lady, most likely not.",63,[set()]
sansa stark,"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.

petyr baelish,Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.,63,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,So they should be.,63,[set()]
petyr baelish,I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --,63,"[{'cersei'}, set()]"
sansa stark,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.,63,[{'cersei'}]

petyr baelish,"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.

guard,"Lady Sansa, at the gate.",63,[{'sansa'}]
bran stark,"Hello, Sansa.",63,[{'sansa'}]
sansa stark,I wish Jon was here.,63,[{'jon'}]
bran stark,Yes. I need to speak to him.,63,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.,63,"[set(), set()]"
bran stark,I can never be the Lord of Winterfell. I can never be lord of anything. I'm the three-eyed raven.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,I don't know what that means.,63,[set()]
bran stark,It's difficult to explain.,63,[set()]
sansa stark,"Try, please, for me.",63,[set()]
bran stark,"It means I can see everything. Everything that's ever happened to everyone. Everything that's happening right now. It's all pieces, fragments. I need to learn to see better. When the long night comes again I need to be ready.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,How do you know all of this?,63,[set()]
bran stark,The three-eyed raven taught me.,63,[set()]
sansa stark,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.,63,[set()]
bran stark,I told you it's difficult to explain.,63,[set()]
sansa stark,Bran --,63,[{'bran'}]
bran stark,I'm sorry for all that's happened to you. I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home. It was so beautiful that night. Snow falling just like now. And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,"I have to go back inside, Bran.",63,[{'bran'}]
bran stark,I'll stay a bit longer.,63,[set()]
marwyn,Hmm.,63,[set()]
marwyn,Hmm. Does it hurt?,63,"[set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,A bit. Less than before.,63,"[set(), set()]"
marwyn,The infection no longer appears to be active.,63,[set()]
marwyn,Unusual. Unlikely. One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,And the climate.,63,[set()]
marwyn,"The climate? You're free to go, Ser. This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer.",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
marwyn,"Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.",63,[{'tarley'}]
jorah mormont,How bad is it?,63,[set()]
sam tarly,I suppose I'll find out this evening.,63,[set()]
sam tarly,Where will you go?,63,[set()]
jorah mormont,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.,63,"[set(), set(), {'daenerys'}, set()]"
jorah mormont,I owe my life to her and you.,63,[set()]
sam tarly,Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.,63,"[set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,Perhaps our paths will cross again?,63,[set()]
sam tarly,I hope they do.,63,[set()]
marwyn,You treated him?,63,[set()]
sam tarly,Yes.,63,[set()]
marwyn,Who told you to treat him?,63,[set()]
sam tarly,No one.,63,[set()]
marwyn,Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?,63,[set()]
sam tarly,I seem to remember you.,63,[set()]
marwyn,But you treated him anyway?,63,[set()]
sam tarly,I did.,63,[set()]
marwyn,"I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful. Especially on someone of that age. You could have infected yourself and others. You could have devastated the entire Citadel. But you didn't. It's a meticulous, difficult procedure. Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed. But you succeeded. How?",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sam tarly,I read the books and followed the instructions.,63,[set()]
marwyn,That man is alive because of you. You should be proud.,63,"[set(), set()]"
sam tarly,"Thank you, Archmaester.",63,[{'archmaester'}]
marwyn,Come here.,63,[set()]
marwyn,All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away. I need you to make copies of them.,63,"[set(), set()]"
marwyn,You were expecting a reward? Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel. You'd better get started. Be mindful of the paper mites. They like flesh as well.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.,63,[{'euron'}]
varys,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --",63,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?",63,"[set(), {'vicerion', 'drogon', 'rhaegal'}, set()]"
missandei,They can still do something to you. It only takes one arrow.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,It's too great a risk. You're too important.,63,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,What about Casterly Rock?,63,[set()]
varys,The Unsullied will be there soon.,63,[set()]
missandei,And what will they face?,63,[set()]
varys,A difficult situation. They know we're coming.,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.,63,"[set(), {'cersei', 'lannister'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,No one has ever taken the rock.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming.",63,"[{'lannister'}, set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,They will be ready.,63,[set()]
man,Draw! Loose!,63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.,63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.",63,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.""",63,[set()]
tyrion lannister,And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.,63,"[set(), {'lannister'}, set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
unsullied,There are none left.,63,[set()]
grey worm,There are supposed to be more than this. Many more.,63,"[set(), set()]"
grey worm,Where are they? Where are the rest of the Lannisters?,63,"[set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,It's done?,63,[set()]
jaime lannister,It is.,63,[set()]
olenna tyrell,And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?,63,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,I suppose as well as can be expected.,63,[set()]
olenna tyrell,It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.",63,"[set(), set(), {'cersei'}]"
olenna tyrell,So you'll just let them take it?,63,[set()]
jaime lannister,"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.",63,"[set(), set(), {'euron'}, set()]"
olenna tyrell,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?",63,[set()]
jaime lannister,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.,63,"[{'robb'}, set()]"
olenna tyrell,Yes. You must be very wise by now.,63,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,My father always said I was a slow learner.,63,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?",63,"[{'joffrey'}, set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Widow's Wail.,63,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'tyrell'}, set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?",63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?",63,"[set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.,63,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"Yes, it has.",63,[set()]
olenna tyrell,She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.,63,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,I think we're done here.,63,[set()]
olenna tyrell,How will it happen?,63,[set()]
jaime lannister,Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.,63,"[{'cersei'}, set(), set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,Will there be pain?,63,[set()]
jaime lannister,No. I made sure of that.,63,"[set(), set()]"
olenna tyrell,That's good.,63,[set()]
olenna tyrell,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me.",63,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'cersei'}, set()]"
end,CREDITS,63,[set()]
jaime lannister,Halt that wagon!,64,[set()]
jaime lannister,opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.,64,"[set(), set(), {'bronn'}]"
bronn,You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?,64,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.,64,[set()]
bronn,There is no more High Septon.,64,[set()]
jaime lannister,"No, there isn't, is there?",64,[set()]
bronn,There is still the question of my prize.,64,[set()]
jaime lannister,is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.,64,"[set(), {'bronn'}]"
jaime lannister,That's a lot of money I just gave you.,64,[set()]
bronn,It's not a castle.,64,[set()]
bronn,turns and points to Highgarden.,64,[set()]
bronn,How about that one? It's available.,64,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,You don't want Highgarden.,64,[set()]
bronn,I beg to differ.,64,[set()]
jaime lannister,"We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down.",64,"[set(), {'daenerys'}, set(), set()]"
bronn,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?",64,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.,64,[set()]
jaime lannister,They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.,64,"[set(), set(), set()]"
bronn,Right. Just not to me.,64,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.",64,"[{'bronn'}, set()]"
bronn,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.",64,[{'cersei'}]
jaime lannister,Stranger things have happened.,64,[set()]
bronn,Like what?,64,[set()]
randyll,TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback. RANDYLL addresses JAIME.,64,"[{'tarley', 'dickon'}, {'jaime', 'randyll'}]"
randyll,"The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord.",64,[set()]
jaime lannister,The current harvest?,64,[set()]
dickon,We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.,64,[set()]
jaime lannister,looks over to BRONN.,64,[{'bronn'}]
jaime lannister,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?",64,"[{'bronn', 'tarleys'}]"
bronn,I'm not much for shoveling weight.,64,[set()]
jaime lannister,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.",64,[set()]
randyll,My Lord.,64,[set()]
dickon,My Lord.,64,[set()]
randyll,DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance. Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road.,64,"[{'bronn', 'lannister', 'dickon'}, {'lannister'}]"
cersei lannister,and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.,64,[{'tycho'}]
tycho,"I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment. I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely.",64,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"You're too kind, My Lord.",64,[set()]
tycho,"I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace. I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment. And the current arithmetic is outstanding. The gold --",64,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.,64,"[set(), set()]"
tycho,Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed. They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.,64,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.,64,[set()]
tycho,Yes. Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.,64,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.,64,[set()]
tycho,I see a great deal of potential in that venture. I imagine that it would require outside investment?,64,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.",64,"[set(), set(), {'qyburn'}]"
tycho,I know them well. They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.,64,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.,64,"[set(), set()]"
tycho,"Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives.",64,[set()]
bran stark,is sitting in a wheelchair. PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him. BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN. It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.,64,"[set(), {'peter'}, {'bran', 'baelish'}, {'bran'}]"
petyr baelish,This is for you.,64,[set()]
petyr baelish,flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.,64,[{'bran'}]
petyr baelish,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.",64,[set()]
bran stark,"reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully.",64,[set()]
petyr baelish,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.",64,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'brandon'}]"
bran stark,Do you know who this belonged to?,64,[set()]
petyr baelish,"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.",64,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
petyr baelish,hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.,64,"[{'bran'}, {'bran'}]"
petyr baelish,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --",64,[set()]
bran stark,Chaos is a ladder.,64,[set()]
bran stark,is staring at BAELISH. BAELISH stops speaking. The door opens and Meera appears.,64,"[{'baelish'}, {'baelish'}, {'meera'}]"
petyr baelish,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.",64,[{'stark'}]
petyr baelish,stands up to leave.,64,[set()]
bran stark,I'm not Lord Stark.,64,[{'stark'}]
petyr baelish,bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.,64,[{'meera'}]
meera,notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.,64,[{'bran'}]
meera,What's that?,64,[set()]
bran stark,Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.,64,[{'wolkan'}]
meera,It's a very good idea.,64,[set()]
bran stark,You're leaving?,64,[set()]
meera,"I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family. And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now. You don't need me anymore.",64,"[set(), set(), set()]"
bran stark,"No, I don't.",64,[set()]
meera,That's all you've got to say?,64,[set()]
bran stark,Thank you.,64,[set()]
meera,Thank you?,64,[set()]
bran stark,For helping me.,64,[set()]
meera,My brother died for you. Hodor and Summer died for you. I almost died for you. Bran!,64,"[set(), {'summer', 'hodor'}, set(), set()]"
bran stark,"I'm not really, not anymore. I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now.",64,"[set(), {'brandon'}]"
meera,begins to cry.,64,[set()]
meera,You died in that cave.,64,[set()]
meera,"turns to walk out the door. She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out.",64,"[set(), {'bran'}]"
arya stark,approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.,64,"[set(), set(), set(), {'arya'}]"
man,"Hey, oh. Where are you going?",64,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,In there. I live here.,64,"[set(), set()]"
man,Fuck off.,64,[set()]
arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.,64,"[{'arya'}, set()]"
man,Arya Stark is dead.,64,[{'arya'}]
arya stark,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.,64,"[{'rodrick', 'llewyn'}, set()]"
man,There's no Rodrick here.,64,[{'rodrick'}]
man,Maester's name is Wolkan.,64,[{'wolkan'}]
arya stark,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother",64,"[{'jon'}, set()]"
man,He's a thousand miles away.,64,[set()]
man,"It's cold. We're busy. So, you know, best fuck off.",64,"[set(), set(), set()]"
man,Mm-hmm.,64,[set()]
arya stark,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?,64,[{'jon'}]
man,"The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark.",64,[{'stark'}]
arya stark,Which Lady Stark?,64,[{'stark'}]
man,You tell us. You're the one impersonating her sister.,64,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,Tell Sansa her sister is home.,64,[{'sansa'}]
man,"Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us. So for the last time, fuck off.",64,"[{'sansa'}, set()]"
man,1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.,64,[{'arya'}]
arya stark,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...",64,"[set(), set(), {'sansa'}]"
arya stark,keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.,64,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
man,You sit there. Right there. Don't move.,64,"[set(), set(), set()]"
man,Go tell Lady Stark. I'll watch her.,64,"[{'stark'}, set()]"
arya stark,is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.,64,"[set(), set(), {'arya'}, set()]"
man,You tell her.,64,[set()]
man,I'm not.,64,[set()]
man,Because if you don't I'll hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can.,64,[set()]
man,We told her to wait. We were standing right next to her.,64,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,sighs.,64,[set()]
man,"When we turned around she had gone, My Lady. She was nothing. Some winter town girl.",64,"[set(), set(), set()]"
man,She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.,64,"[{'rodrick', 'llewyn'}]"
man,"Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady. We'll find her.",64,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,You don't have to. I know where she is.,64,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.,64,"[{'ned'}, {'sansa', 'arya'}, {'sansa', 'arya'}]"
arya stark,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?,64,[{'lady'}]
sansa stark,hesitates for a moment.,64,[set()]
sansa stark,Yes.,64,[set()]
sansa stark,begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.,64,"[set(), {'arya'}]"
sansa stark,You shouldn't have run from the guards.,64,[set()]
arya stark,I didn't run. You need better guards.,64,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,smirks at ARYA.,64,[set()]
arya stark,"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?",64,"[{'stark'}, {'jon'}]"
sansa stark,"He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.",64,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.,64,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Everyone who knew his face is dead.,64,[set()]
arya stark,We're not.,64,[set()]
arya stark,turns to face SANSA.,64,[{'sansa'}]
arya stark,They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?,64,"[{'joffrey'}, set()]"
sansa stark,I wish I had.,64,[set()]
arya stark,Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.,64,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Your list?,64,[set()]
arya stark,Of people I'm going to kill.,64,[set()]
sansa stark,begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.,64,"[set(), {'arya'}]"
sansa stark,How did you get back to Winterfell?,64,[set()]
arya stark,It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.,64,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.,64,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.",64,[set()]

arya stark,Where did you get this?,64,[set()]
bran stark,Littlefinger gave it to me.,64,[{'littlefinger'}]
arya stark,"Littlefinger, he's here?",64,[{'littlefinger'}]

sansa stark,He's declared for House Stark.,64,[{'house'}]
sansa stark,steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.,64,[{'bran'}]
sansa stark,Why would he give you a dagger?,64,[set()]
bran stark,He thought I'd want it.,64,[set()]
sansa stark,Why?,64,[set()]
bran stark,Because it was meant to kill me.,64,[set()]
sansa stark,The cutthroat after your fall?,64,[set()]
arya stark,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?,64,[set()]
bran stark,Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.,64,[set()]
sansa stark,He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.,64,"[set(), set()]"
bran stark,It doesn't matter.,64,[set()]
sansa stark,What do you mean it doesn't matter?,64,[set()]
bran stark,I don't want it.,64,[set()]
bran stark,holds the knife out to ARYA. ARYA looks at BRAN.,64,"[{'arya'}, {'bran', 'arya'}]"
arya stark,Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.,64,"[set(), set()]"
bran stark,It's wasted on a cripple.,64,[set()]

arya stark,is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs.

daenerys targaryen,and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.,64,[{'missandei'}]
missandei,"Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied.",64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Soon. They will come back to me.,64,"[set(), set()]"

missandei,Many things.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Many things?,64,[set()]
jon snow,Your Grace.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.,64,"[{'missandei'}, set()]"
daenerys targaryen,It's all right.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.,64,"[{'jon', 'missandei'}, set(), set()]"
jon snow,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.,64,[set()]
jon snow,leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.,64,"[{'daenerys', 'missandei'}, set(), set()]"
jon snow,"So this is it, all we'll ever need.",64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.,64,[set()]
jon snow,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.",64,[set()]
jon snow,and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.,64,"[{'daenerys'}, set()]"
jon snow,The Children of the Forest made these.,64,[{'the'}]
daenerys targaryen,When?,64,[set()]
jon snow,A very long time ago.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.,64,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,No.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.,64,"[{'jon'}, {'jon'}, set()]"
jon snow,They were here together the Children and the First Men.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Doing what? Fighting each other?,64,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.,64,"[{'daenerys'}, {'the'}]"
daenerys targaryen,"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",64,"[set(), set(), set()]"

daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JON.,64,[{'jon'}]
daenerys targaryen,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?,64,[set()]
jon snow,"No, I don't think I can.",64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,steps forward closer to JON.,64,[{'jon'}]
daenerys targaryen,I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.,64,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.",64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.,64,[{'jon'}]
daenerys targaryen,They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?,64,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion.",64,"[{'daenerys', 'missandei', 'davos'}, {'tyrion', 'varys'}, {'daenerys', 'tyrion'}]"
daenerys targaryen,What is it?,64,[set()]
tyrion lannister,We took Casterly Rock.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,That's very good to hear.,64,[set()]
tyrion lannister,and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.,64,"[{'varys'}, set()]"

davos,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --,64,"[set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,We still have the largest army.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.,64,[{'cersei'}]
tyrion lannister,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.,64,"[{'grey'}, set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion.",64,[{'tyrion'}]
daenerys targaryen,"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.",64,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,If I've underestimated our enemies --,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.",64,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.,64,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Enough with the clever plans.,64,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,turns back and looks at TYRION.,64,[{'tyrion'}]
daenerys targaryen,I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.,64,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,We've discussed this.,64,[set()]

daenerys targaryen,begins walking close to JON.,64,[{'jon'}]
jon snow,looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.,64,[set()]
jon snow,I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.,64,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,glances back towards the dragons.,64,[set()]
jon snow,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.",64,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.,64,[set()]

BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground.

brienne,Who taught you to do that?,64,[set()]

jon snow,and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.,64,[{'davos'}]
davos,What do you think of her?,64,[set()]
jon snow,Who?,64,[set()]
davos,sighs,64,[set()]
davos,I believe you know of whom I speak.,64,[set()]
jon snow,I think she has a good heart.,64,[set()]
davos,A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.,64,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?",64,"[set(), {'the', 'davos'}, set(), set(), set(), set()]"
davos,Fewer.,64,[set()]

jon snow,Of course.,64,[set()]
missandei,"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?",64,"[{'jon', 'ned'}]"
jon snow,I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.,64,"[set(), set()]"
davos,Is the custom different in Naarth?,64,[set()]
missandei,We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.,64,[set()]
davos,The sounds liberating.,64,[set()]
jon snow,Why did you leave your homeland?,64,[set()]
missandei,I was stolen away by slavers.,64,[set()]
jon snow,I'm sorry.,64,[set()]
davos,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?",64,[{'daenerys'}]
missandei,She bought me from my master and set me free.,64,[set()]
davos,"That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?",64,"[set(), set()]"
missandei,I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.,64,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --,64,[set()]
missandei,Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.,64,[set()]
jon snow,You believe that?,64,[set()]
missandei,"I know it. All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her. She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew. She's the queen we chose.",64,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies.

daenerys targaryen,You will not kneel?,65,[set()]
randyll,I already have a queen.,65,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.",65,"[set(), set()]"
randyll,"There are no easy choices in war. Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life. You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader. One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back.",65,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.,65,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS.,65,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall.",65,"[set(), set(), set()]"
randyll,You cannot send me to the Wall. You are not my queen.,65,"[set(), set()]"

daenerys targaryen,Who are you?,65,[set()]
randyll,A stupid boy.,65,[set()]
dickon,"I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley.",65,"[{'randyll', 'dickon'}]"
tyrion lannister,You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.,65,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.",65,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.,65,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --",65,[set()]

daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.,65,[set()]
drogon,draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men. They are instantly engulfed in flames. They both collapse into ash after a few seconds. There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood. The Lannister men recoil in horror. Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground.

cersei lannister,How many men did we lose?,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,We haven't done a full counting.,65,[set()]
cersei lannister,"It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries.",65,"[set(), set(), set()]"

cersei lannister,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.",65,[set()]
jaime lannister,"I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.

cersei lannister,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.",65,[set()]

jaime lannister,After.,65,[set()]
cersei lannister,And you believed her?,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control?

jon snow,SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount.

jon snow,Thousands.,65,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.,65,"[set(), set(), set(), {'davos'}]"
jon snow,Ser Davos gets carried away.,65,[{'davos'}]

sam tarly,Brandon Stark --,65,[{'brandon'}]
sam tarly,the crippled boy.,65,[set()]
marwyn,Do you know him?,65,[set()]
sam tarly,I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.,65,"[set(), set()]"
marwyn,And?,65,[set()]
sam tarly,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say.",65,"[set(), set(), set()]"
maester,Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.,65,[set()]
marwyn,I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.,65,[set()]
sam tarly,steps forward and clears his throat.,65,[set()]
sam tarly,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.

marwyn,It could be done. And this news could be authentic. It's possible. It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.,65,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
maester,That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.,65,[set()]
sam tarly,"Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it.",65,"[{'archmaester'}, set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,"I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her.",65,"[set(), set()]"

daenerys targaryen,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.,65,"[{'cersei'}, set()]"

arya stark,Not if they lose their heads first.,65,[set()]
sansa stark,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.

tyrion lannister,"You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud.",65,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Don't talk about our father.,65,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Listen to me --,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.,65,[{'bronn'}]
tyrion lannister,glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.,65,[{'jaime'}]
tyrion lannister,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,shakes his head and says nothing.,65,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him.

jaime lannister,What do you want?,65,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.,65,"[{'daenerys'}, set(), set(), {'daenerys'}, {'cersei'}]"
jaime lannister,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.,65,[{'cersei'}]

davos,I wasn't sure I'd find you.,65,[set()]
davos,I thought you might still be rowing.,65,[set()]

gendry baratheon,Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?,65,[{'goldcloaks'}]
davos,I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.,65,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
davos,"walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY.",65,"[set(), set(), {'gendry'}]"
davos,Anybody give you any trouble?,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,Here I am arming Lannisters. I never get a second look. You were right. Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.,65,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
davos,Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.,65,"[set(), set(), set()]"

gendry baratheon,You came to get me. You want me to come with you.,65,"[set(), set()]"
davos,I think you need to understand --,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,I'm ready. Let's go.,65,"[set(), set()]"
davos,You should know what you're heading into.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father? They tried to kill me.,65,"[set(), set()]"
gendry baratheon,is tossing his tools and apron to the side. He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.,65,"[set(), set()]"
gendry baratheon,"I've been getting ready. I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes.",65,"[set(), set()]"
davos,You might want to bring one of those swords.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.,65,[{'davos'}]
gendry baratheon,"I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --",65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,removes a giant war hammer from the wall.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,this I know.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.,65,[{'davos'}]
davos,and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.,65,"[{'gendry', 'davos'}]"
davos,Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.,65,"[set(), set()]"
gendry baratheon,and DAVOS arrive at the boat. GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo. DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope. Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.,65,"[{'davos'}, {'gendry'}, set(), {'goldcloaks', 'gendry', 'davos'}]"
gendry baratheon,Who should I say I am?,65,[set()]

davos,It is.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.,65,[set()]
guard,The docks are that way.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,That they are. I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.,65,"[set(), set()]"
davos,Still five gold dragons?,65,[set()]
guard,Are you joking?,65,[set()]
guard,You must be even older than you look. 15.,65,"[set(), set()]"

davos,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.,65,[set()]
davos,turns and begins walking back to his boat.,65,[set()]
guard,What's in the boat?,65,[set()]
davos,pauses and turns back to the guards.,65,[set()]
davos,Not more gold.,65,[set()]
guard,Wine?,65,[set()]
guard,Mmm.,65,[{'mmm'}]
guard,I like wine.,65,[set()]
guard,Or hams.,65,[set()]
davos,Come and have a look.,65,[set()]
davos,Fermented crab.,65,[set()]
guard,What?,65,[set()]
davos,"Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste.",65,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
davos,scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.,65,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
davos,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.,65,[set()]
guard,"Oi, Dwarf!",65,[set()]
davos,quickly walks to cut the guards off.,65,[set()]
davos,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.,65,[set()]
guard,That dwarf --,65,[set()]
guard,Where did you get that scar?,65,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.,65,"[set(), set()]"
guard,We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.,65,[set()]
davos,is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.,65,"[set(), set()]"
davos,Perhaps there's some arrangement?,65,[set()]
guard,Arrangement? You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?,65,"[set(), {'cersei'}]"
gendry baratheon,"can be seen behind the backs of the guards. He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2. He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guardo s head. The man drops. As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face.",65,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'gendry'}]"
davos,is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.,65,[set()]
davos,This is Gendry.,65,[{'gendry'}]
tyrion lannister,He'll do.,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.,65,"[set(), {'qyburn', 'cersei'}]"
cersei lannister,That won't be necessary.,65,[set()]
qyburn,bows his head and walks to leave the room. As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.,65,"[set(), {'jaime'}]"
qyburn,Ser Jaime.,65,[{'ser'}]
qyburn,closes the door as he leaves. JAIME and CERSEI are alone. CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.,65,"[set(), {'jaime', 'cersei'}, {'jaime', 'cersei'}]"
jaime lannister,Why was QYBURN here?,65,[{'qyburn'}]
cersei lannister,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?,65,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,I met with Tyrion.,65,[{'tyrion'}]
cersei lannister,pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.,65,[{'jaime'}]
cersei lannister,What did our brother have to say?,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,Daenerys wants to meet.,65,[{'daenerys'}]
cersei lannister,To discuss a surrender?,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,To discuss an armistice.,65,[set()]
cersei lannister,She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?,65,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.,65,"[set(), {'tyrion'}]"
cersei lannister,smirks and looks away from JAIME.,65,[{'jaime'}]
cersei lannister,Are you going to punish him?,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,Tyrion?,65,[set()]
cersei lannister,Bronn.,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,looks confused.,65,[set()]
cersei lannister,He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?,65,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,You let it happen. Why?,65,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this.",65,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.,65,"[set(), {'jaime'}]"
jaime lannister,Who will you say is the father?,65,[set()]
cersei lannister,You.,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,People won't like that.,65,[set()]
cersei lannister,stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.,65,[{'jaime'}]
cersei lannister,Do you remember what father used to say about people?,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.,65,[set()]
jaime lannister,reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.,65,"[{'cersei'}, {'jaime'}]"
cersei lannister,Never betray me again.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave. Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave. DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.,65,"[{'davos'}, set(), {'gendry', 'davos'}]"
davos,We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.,65,"[set(), set()]"
gendry baratheon,I understand.,65,[set()]
davos,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,You don't have to worry.,65,[set()]
davos,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.",65,[{'clovis'}]

jon snow,stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.,65,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,I grew up on stories about them.,65,[set()]
gendry baratheon,"All I ever knew was they fought together and won. Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why. Let me come with you.",65,"[set(), {'your', 'davos'}, set()]"

tormund,"You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling. Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man. The king beyond the wall never bent the knee. How many of his people died for his pride?",66,"[set(), {'mance'}, set(), set()]"
thoros,"Are you still mad at us, boy?",66,[set()]
gendry baratheon,You sold me to a witch.,66,[set()]
thoros,"Priestess. I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.",66,"[set(), set()]"
beric,We're fighting a great war. Wars cost money.,66,"[set(), set()]"
gendry baratheon,"I wanted to be one of you. I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave. Do you know what she did to me? She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --",66,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sandor,Sounds all right so far.,66,[set()]
gendry baratheon,and put leeches on me.,66,[set()]
sandor,Was she naked too?,66,[set()]
thoros,She needed your blood.,66,[set()]
gendry baratheon,Yes. Thank you. I know that.,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sandor,steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.,66,[set()]
sandor,It could have been worse.,66,[set()]
gendry baratheon,She wanted to kill me. They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --,66,"[set(), {'davos'}]"
sandor,"But they didn't, did they? So what you whinging about?",66,"[set(), set()]"
gendry baratheon,I'm not whinging.,66,[set()]
sandor,Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something. That's whinging.,66,"[set(), set()]"
sandor,motions to BERIC.,66,[set()]
sandor,This one's been killed six times. You don't hear him bitching about it.,66,"[set(), set()]"
sandor,walks away to join the group. BERIC and THOROS smile to each other. THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.,66,"[set(), {'beric', 'thoros'}, {'thoros', 'gendry'}]"
thoros,Good lad.,66,[set()]
jon snow,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.,66,[set()]
jorah mormont,He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.",66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.,66,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,Your father wanted to execute me.,66,[set()]
jon snow,I heard.,66,[set()]
jorah mormont,He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.,66,"[set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,and JON glance at each other.,66,[{'jon'}]
jon snow,I'm glad he didn't capture you.,66,[set()]
jorah mormont,Me too.,66,[set()]
jon snow,stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.,66,[set()]
jon snow,"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.",66,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.,66,"[{'jorah'}, {'jorah'}]"
jon snow,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.,66,[{'mormont'}]
jorah mormont,stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.,66,[{'jon'}]
jon snow,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.,66,"[set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,"pauses, then nods at JON.",66,[{'jon'}]
jorah mormont,He gave it to you.,66,[set()]
jon snow,I'm not his son.,66,[set()]
jorah mormont,"pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands.",66,[set()]
jorah mormont,I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.,66,"[set(), set()]"
jorah mormont,resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.,66,[{'jon'}]
jorah mormont,I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.,66,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,I remember.,66,[set()]
arya stark,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.",66,"[{'ser'}, {'bran'}, {'rodrick'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,starts a slow clap.,66,[set()]
arya stark,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.,66,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,turns to look at ARYA.,66,[set()]
sansa stark,What?,66,[set()]
arya stark,retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.,66,[set()]
arya stark,"That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --",66,"[set(), {'septa'}, {'robb'}, {'robert'}, set()]"
sansa stark,You don't have to read it. I remember.,66,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,"Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa.",66,"[set(), {'robert', 'joffrey'}, set(), {'lannister', 'stark', 'joffrey'}, {'sansa'}]"
sansa stark,They forced me to do it.,66,[set()]
arya stark,Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.,66,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.,66,[set()]
sansa stark,They told me it was the only way to save father.,66,[set()]
arya stark,And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.,66,"[set(), {'cersei', 'joffrey'}, set(), set()]"
sansa stark,You were there?,66,[set()]
arya stark,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.,66,[{'baelor'}]
sansa stark,And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
arya stark,I wanted to.,66,[set()]
sansa stark,But you didn't. Just like me.,66,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.,66,"[set(), {'robb'}, {'joffrey'}]"
sansa stark,"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?",66,"[set(), set(), set(), {'jon'}, set(), {'the'}]"
arya stark,I was training.,66,[set()]
sansa stark,"Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.",66,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot.",66,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,You never would have survived what I survived.,66,[set()]
arya stark,I guess we'll never know.,66,[set()]
sansa stark,What are you doing to do with that letter.,66,[set()]
arya stark,I don't know yet.,66,[set()]
sansa stark,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?,66,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you.",66,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Arya --,66,[{'arya'}]
arya stark,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.,66,"[{'jon'}, set(), {'jon'}, set(), set()]"
sansa stark,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --",66,"[{'cersei'}, set(), set()]"
arya stark,"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?",66,"[set(), {'sansa', 'cersei'}, {'lyanna'}, set(), set()]"
sansa stark,You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.,66,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.,66,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,turns and walks away.,66,[set()]
tormund,You're the one they call the dog.,66,[set()]
sandor,Fuck off.,66,[set()]
tormund,They told me you were mean. Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?,66,"[set(), {'wildlings'}]"
sandor,I don't give two shits about Wildlings.,66,[set()]
sandor,looks up at TORMUND.,66,[set()]
sandor,Gingers I hate.,66,[set()]
tormund,Gingers are beautiful. We are kissed by fire. Just like you.,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tormund,points and motions to SANDOR's burned face. SANDOR slaps his hand away.,66,"[{'sandor'}, {'sandor'}]"
sandor,Don't point your fucking finger at me.,66,[set()]
sandor,walks away to rejoin the group. TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.,66,"[set(), {'tormund'}]"
tormund,Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?,66,[set()]
sandor,I didn't trip. I was pushed.,66,"[set(), set()]"
tormund,Ever since you've been mean.,66,[set()]
sandor,Will you fuck off?,66,[set()]
tormund,I don't think you're truly mean. You have sad eyes.,66,"[set(), set()]"
sandor,stops and turns to TORMUND.,66,[set()]
sandor,Do you want to suck my dick? Is that it?,66,"[set(), set()]"
tormund,Dick?,66,[{'dick'}]
sandor,Cock.,66,[set()]
tormund,Ah. Dick. I like it.,66,"[set(), {'dick'}, set()]"
sandor,I bet you do.,66,[set()]
sandor,"turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows.",66,[{'tormund'}]
tormund,Nope. It's pussy for me. I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell. If I ever get back there. Yellow hair. Blue eyes. Tallest woman you've ever seen. Almost as tall as you.,66,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sandor,stops and glances at TORMUND.,66,[{'tormund'}]
sandor,Brienne of Tarth.,66,[{'brienne'}]
tormund,You know her?,66,[set()]
sandor,You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?,66,"[{'brienne', 'tarth'}]"
tormund,"Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me.",66,[set()]
sandor,How does she look at you? Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?,66,"[set(), set()]"
tormund,nods.,66,[set()]
tormund,You do know her.,66,[set()]
sandor,We've met.,66,[set()]
sandor,and TORMUND begin walking.,66,[{'tormund'}]
tormund,I want to make babies with her. Think of the great big monsters. They'd conquer the world.,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sandor,How did a mad fucker like you live this long?,66,[set()]
tormund,I'm good at killing people.,66,[set()]
beric,You don't much look like him.,66,[set()]
jon snow,Who's that?,66,[set()]
beric,Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.,66,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,You knew him?,66,[set()]
beric,Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.,66,"[set(), {'hand'}, {'wildling'}, {'thoros'}, set()]"
jon snow,I serve the north.,66,[set()]
beric,The north didn't raise you from the dead.,66,[set()]
jon snow,The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
beric,He wants you alive.,66,[set()]
jon snow,Why?,66,[set()]
beric,I don't know.,66,[set()]
jon snow,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.",66,"[set(), set()]"
beric,I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.,66,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,So what are you fighting for?,66,[set()]
beric,Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.,66,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,But we all die.,66,[set()]
beric,The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.,66,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.,66,[set()]
beric,Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.,66,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Aye. Maybe that's enough.,66,"[set(), set()]"
sandor,stops and looks into the distance. There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.,66,"[set(), set()]"
sandor,That's what I saw in the fire.,66,[set()]
sandor,points towards the mountain.,66,[set()]
sandor,A mountain like an arrowhead.,66,[set()]
thoros,Are you sure?,66,[set()]
sandor,turns to THOROS and nods his head.,66,[{'thoros'}]
sandor,We're getting close.,66,[set()]
tyrion lannister,is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.,66,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Do you know what I like about you?,66,[set()]
tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAENERYS.,66,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I honestly don't.,66,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,You're not a hero.,66,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.,66,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.,66,[{'tyrion'}]
tyrion lannister,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.,66,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.",66,"[set(), set(), {'this', 'dario', 'jorah', 'drogo'}]"
tyrion lannister,"It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.",66,"[set(), {'this', 'dario', 'jorah', 'drogo'}]"
daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow's not in love with me.,66,[{'jon'}]
tyrion lannister,"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.",66,"[set(), set()]"
bronn,Oil?,67,[set()]
soldier,"Pitch, my lord.",67,[set()]
bronn,How many barrels?,67,[set()]
soldier,"500, my lord.",67,[set()]
bronn,Get 500 more.,67,[set()]
soldier,"Yes, my lord.",67,[set()]
bronn,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord.""",67,[set()]
jaime lannister,The thrill will fade.,67,[set()]
bronn,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?,67,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Gold?,67,[set()]
bronn,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?,67,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Family.,67,[set()]
bronn,"Not without a cock, you don't.",67,[set()]
jaime lannister,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.,67,[set()]
bronn,"Yet, your brother--",67,[set()]
jaime lannister,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.",67,[set()]
bronn,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.,67,[set()]
man,"Archers, stand tall!",67,[set()]
man,Cover that wall!,67,[set()]
jon snow,How many people live here?,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"A million, give or take.",67,[set()]
jon snow,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?,67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.,67,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Why isn't she with them?,67,[set()]
qyburn,"I'm afraid I don't know, Your Grace. No one has seen her.",67,"[{'your'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,And the rest of them?,67,[set()]
qyburn,They're on their way to the dragon pit now.,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,Including our brother.,67,[set()]
qyburn,"Yes, Your Grace.",67,[set()]
cersei lannister,"If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.",67,[set()]
missandei,Why did they build it?,67,[set()]
jorah mormont,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.",67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.",67,"[set(), set(), {'balerion'}]"
davos,Maybe it still is.,67,[set()]
bronn,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did.",67,"[set(), set()]"
bronn,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.,67,[set()]
podrick,"I never thought I'd see you again, my lord.",67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Supporting the enemy, no less.",67,[set()]
podrick,Hard to blame you.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Cersei will anyway.,67,[{'cersei'}]
podrick,I'm glad you're alive.,67,[set()]
bronn,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.,67,"[set(), set()]"
soldier,What's in there?,67,[set()]
sandor,Fuck off.,67,[set()]
brienne,I thought you were dead.,67,[set()]
sandor,Not yet. You came pretty close.,67,"[set(), set()]"
brienne,I was only trying to protect her.,67,[set()]
sandor,You and me both.,67,[set()]
brienne,She's alive. Arya.,67,"[set(), {'arya'}]"
sandor,Where?,67,[set()]
brienne,Winterfell.,67,[set()]
sandor,Who's protecting her if you're here?,67,[set()]
brienne,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.,67,[set()]
sandor,It won't be me.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.,67,"[set(), set()]"
podrick,"It is, my lord.",67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.",67,"[{'podrick'}, {'ser'}]"
bronn,I'm sure your new queen--,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,You've been thinking about our new queen.,67,[set()]
varys,"And that would be double what now, exactly?",67,[set()]
bronn,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.,67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.",67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
bronn,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.",67,"[set(), set(), {'cersei'}, set(), set(), {'ser'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,It's good to see you again.,67,[set()]
bronn,"Yeah, you, too.",67,[set()]
sandor,"Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.",67,[set()]
bronn,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?",67,"[{'pod'}, set()]"
sandor,I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?,67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,You might.,67,[set()]
sandor,And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.,67,"[set(), {'lannister'}]"
tyrion lannister,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.,67,[{'clegane'}]
sandor,"Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother.",67,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Where is she?,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,She'll be here soon.,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,Didn't travel with you?,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,No.,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,We've been here for some time.,67,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,My apologies.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,We are all facing a unique,67,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Theon! I have your sister,67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.,67,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.,67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.,67,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,"We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents.",67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Perhaps you ought to sit down.,67,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Why?,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,Sit down or leave.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.",67,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?",67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,We all know that will never happen.,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,Then why are we here?,67,[set()]
jon snow,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.,67,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'tyrion'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.,67,[set()]
jon snow,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.,67,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.",67,"[set(), set(), {'jaime'}]"
daenerys targaryen,Yes. That's all.,67,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.,67,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.,67,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,The word of a would-be usurper.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.,67,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,We can destroy them by burning them.,67,[set()]
jon snow,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.",67,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.,67,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.,67,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,How many?,67,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"A hundred thousand, at least.",67,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Can they swim?,67,[set()]
jon snow,No.,67,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.,67,"[set(), set()]"

euron greyjoy,"I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive.",67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing.

cersei lannister,"In return, the King",67,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Just the King,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.",67,"[set(), set(), set(), {'ned'}, {'ned'}]"
jon snow,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.,67,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), {'daenerys', 'targaryen'}]"
cersei lannister,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.,67,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"

jaime lannister,Fuck loyalty?,67,[set()]
brienne,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.,67,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,And tell her what?,67,[set()]
davos,I wish you hadn't done that.,67,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.",67,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,I know!,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen,67,[set()]
jon snow,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.,67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.,67,"[set(), set()]"
davos,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.",67,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.,67,"[{'cersei'}, set()]"
jon snow,I did this. I should go.,67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.,67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,You spoke with her?,67,[set()]

tyrion lannister,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?",67,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.",67,[set()]
cersei lannister,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.",67,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.",67,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her.",67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I didn't know about that.,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life.",67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Cersei, I didn't know.",67,[{'cersei'}]
cersei lannister,the destruction of this family.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.,67,"[set(), {'daenerys'}, set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,You killed our father,67,[set()]

cersei lannister,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open.

cersei lannister,What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.,67,"[set(), {'jon'}]"

cersei lannister,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.",67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Yes.,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,Why?,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Because I think she will make the world a better place.,67,[set()]
cersei lannister,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.,67,[set()]
tyrion lannister,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.,67,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.,67,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat.

petyr baelish,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.,67,[set()]

petyr baelish,She's your sister,67,[set()]

bran stark,About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.,67,"[set(), set(), set(), {'jon', 'rhaegar'}]"
sam,It's not.,67,[set()]
bran stark,Dornish bastards are named Sand.,67,[{'sand'}]
sam,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.",67,"[{'a'}, {'rhaegar', 'elia'}, {'lyanna', 'rhaegar'}]"
bran stark,Are you certain?,67,[set()]
sam,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?,67,"[{'the'}, set(), set()]"
rhaegar,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.",67,"[{'smith'}, set()]"
lyanna,"Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days.",67,"[{'smith'}, set()]"
bran stark,Robert's Rebellion was built on a lie. Rhaegar didn't kidnap my aunt.,67,"[set(), {'rhaegar'}]"
bran stark,He loved her. And she loved him.,67,"[set(), set()]"
bran stark,And Jon - Jon's real name.,67,[{'jon'}]
lyanna,His name is Aegon.,67,[{'aegon'}]
bran stark,He's never been a bastard.,67,[set()]
brans voice,He needs to know. We need to tell him.,67,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,Are you all right?,67,[set()]
sansa stark,"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.",67,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,You did the right thing.,67,[set()]
sansa stark,You did it.,67,[set()]
arya stark,I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.,67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Does that bother you?,67,[set()]
arya stark,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.,67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,You would have. You're the strongest person I know.,67,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.,67,[set()]
sansa stark,"Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying.",67,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,"In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another.",67,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Father,67,[set()]
arya stark,I miss him.,67,[set()]
sansa stark,"Me, too.",67,[set()]
beric,It's a long way down.,67,[set()]
tormund,Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.,67,"[set(), set()]"
man,"I can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!",67,"[set(), set()]"
man,What is it?,67,[set()]
tormund,Come on! Run! Run!,67,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.,71,"[set(), set()]"
varys,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?",71,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Because I have balls, and you don't.",71,[set()]
jon snow,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.,71,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Look at you.,71,[set()]
jon snow,You're a man.,71,[set()]
bran stark,Almost.,71,[set()]
jon snow,Where's Arya?,71,[{'arya'}]
sansa stark,Lurking somewhere.,71,[set()]
jon snow,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.",71,"[{'daenerys', 'targaryen'}, {'sansa', 'winterfell'}]"
daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.",71,"[{'stark'}, set()]"
sansa stark,"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.",71,[set()]
bran stark,We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.,71,"[set(), {'the'}]"
bran stark,"He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.",71,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?",71,"[set(), {'umber'}]"
umber,"We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.",71,[set()]
umber,And my lord.,71,[set()]
umber,And my queen. Sorry.,71,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.,71,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.,71,"[set(), set(), set()]"
maester wolkan,"At once, Your Grace.",71,[set()]
lyanna mormont,Your Grace.,71,[set()]
lyanna,But you're not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- I'm not sure what you are now.,71,"[set(), set(), set()]"
lyanna,A lord? Nothing at all?,71,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,It's not important.,71,[set()]
lyanna,Not important? We named you King in the North.,71,"[set(), set()]"
man,King of the North!,71,[{'king'}]
jon snow,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.",71,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.",71,"[{'jon'}, set(), set(), set(), {'lannister'}]"
tyrion lannister,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.",71,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?",71,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Whatever they want.,71,[set()]
gendry baratheon,"Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.",71,"[set(), set()]"
man,Sorry 'bout that.,71,[set()]
gendry baratheon,Are these the last of the wagons?,71,[set()]
man,Aye.,71,[set()]
gendry baratheon,"All right, let's get it all to the forges.",71,[set()]
tyrion lannister,My lord. My lady.,71,"[set(), set()]"
royce,My lady.,71,[set()]
tyrion lannister,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.,71,"[{'the'}, set()]"
sansa stark,"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.",71,"[{'hand'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.,71,"[{'joffrey'}, set()]"
sansa stark,It had its moments.,71,[set()]
sansa stark,Apologies for leaving like that.,71,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.",71,[set()]
sansa stark,We both survived.,71,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.,71,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-",71,"[{'lannister'}, set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?,71,[{'cersei'}]
tyrion lannister,She did.,71,[set()]
sansa stark,And you believed her?,71,[set()]
tyrion lannister,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.,71,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.,71,[set()]
arya stark,You used to be taller.,71,[set()]
jon snow,How did you sneak up on me?,71,[set()]
arya stark,How did you survive a knife through the heart?,71,[set()]
jon snow,I didn't.,71,[set()]
jon snow,You still have it.,71,[set()]
arya stark,Needle.,71,[set()]
jon snow,Have you ever used it?,71,[set()]
arya stark,Once or twice.,71,[set()]
arya stark,Valyrian steel.,71,[set()]
jon snow,Jealous?,71,[set()]
arya stark,Too heavy for me.,71,[set()]
jon snow,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.,71,"[set(), {'sansa'}]"
arya stark,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?",71,[set()]
jon snow,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.,71,[{'sansa'}]
arya stark,She's the smartest person I've ever met.,71,[set()]
jon snow,Now you're defending her?,71,[set()]
jon snow,You?,71,[set()]
arya stark,I'm defending our family. So is she.,71,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Yeah. I'm her family too.,71,"[set(), set()]"

qyburn,"Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.",71,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Good.,71,[set()]
yara greyjoy,Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.,71,"[set(), {'greyjoys'}, set()]"
euron greyjoy,If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?,71,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.,71,"[set(), set()]"
yara greyjoy,Are we in King's Landing?,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Mm.,71,[set()]
yara greyjoy,You picked the losing side.,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?",71,[set()]
harry,"Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.",71,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.,71,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,Horses?,71,[set()]
harry,Two thousand.,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,And elephants?,71,[set()]
harry,"Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.",71,[set()]
cersei lannister,That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.,71,"[set(), set()]"
harry,"They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.",71,[set()]
cersei lannister,"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.",71,[{'strickland'}]
harry,"We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.",71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Am I most welcome here?,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Good. As a true friend and an honored guest,71,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,I was hoping we could talk in private.,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,After the war. That was our agreement.,71,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,Wars sometimes last years.,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.",71,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,How?,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,"I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.",71,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,You're insolent. I've executed men for less.,71,"[set(), set()]"
euron greyjoy,They were lesser men.,71,[set()]
dirah,I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.,71,[{'lannister'}]
crayah,Burnt up some of my favorite boys.,71,[set()]
dirah,"Archie, was it?",71,[{'archie'}]
crayah,And William.,71,[{'william'}]
dirah,Tall handsome William?,71,[{'william'}]
crayah,"Yeah, tall handsome William.",71,[{'william'}]
dirah,They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.,71,[set()]
bronn,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.,71,[set()]
crayah,Did you?,71,[set()]
bronn,Nearly killed it.,71,[set()]
marei,That's brave.,71,[set()]
crayah,That boy Eddie.,71,[{'eddie'}]
dirah,The ginger?,71,[set()]
crayah,That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.,71,"[set(), set(), set()]"
dirah,How does he sleep with no eyelids?,71,[set()]
bronn,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?",71,[set()]
qyburn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,71,[{'ser'}]
bronn,You're kidding me.,71,[set()]
qyburn,"Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.",71,[set()]
bronn,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.",71,"[set(), set()]"
crayah,You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.,71,[set()]
qyburn,Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.,71,"[set(), set()]"
bronn,Which girl?,71,[set()]
qyburn,The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.,71,"[set(), {'her'}]"
bronn,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.",71,[set()]
qyburn,"That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.",71,"[{'ser'}, {'cersei'}, set(), set()]"
bronn,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-",71,"[set(), {'the'}]"
qyburn,She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.,71,[{'targaryen'}]
bronn,"Yeah, well, good luck with that.",71,[set()]
qyburn,Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-,71,"[set(), set()]"
qyburn,She has a keen sense of poetic justice.,71,[set()]
bronn,That fucking family.,71,[set()]
qyburn,"When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?",71,"[{'cersei'}, set()]"
cersei lannister,I wanted those elephants.,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,"So, how do I compare to the fat king?",71,[set()]
cersei lannister,You're insulting my late husband?,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Are you offended?,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.",71,[{'robert'}]
euron greyjoy,And the Kingslayer?,71,[{'kingslayer'}]
cersei lannister,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?",71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Life is boring.,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,"You're not boring, I'll give you that.",71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,Do I please the queen?,71,[set()]
cersei lannister,You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.,71,"[set(), set()]"
cersei lannister,But now I want to be alone.,71,[set()]
euron greyjoy,I'm going to put a prince in your belly.,71,[set()]
yara greyjoy,"Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.",71,[{'euron'}]
yara greyjoy,We can take our home back.,71,[set()]
theon greyjoy,Daenerys went north.,71,[{'daenerys'}]
yara greyjoy,Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.,71,"[set(), set()]"
theon greyjoy,You're my queen. I go where you command.,71,"[set(), set()]"
yara greyjoy,You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.,71,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.,71,[set()]
yara greyjoy,But kill the bastards anyway.,71,[set()]

varys,The Karstarks.,71,[{'the'}]

davos,Can't argue with that.,71,[set()]
davos,"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.",71,"[{'karstarks', 'starks'}, {'jon'}]"
tyrion lannister,And our queen is grateful.,71,[set()]
davos,"Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.",71,"[set(), {'jon'}, set(), {'the'}, set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I sense that you're leading to a proposal.,71,[set()]
davos,"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?",71,"[set(), {'the'}]"
tyrion lannister,They do make a handsome couple.,71,[set()]
varys,You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.,71,"[set(), {'daenerys', 'jon'}]"
tyrion lannister,I'm not that old.,71,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Not as old as him.,71,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Our queen respects the wisdom of age.,71,[set()]
varys,"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.",71,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,What is that?,71,[set()]
varys,Nothing lasts.,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Your sister doesn't like me.,71,[set()]
jon snow,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.",71,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-,71,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,How many today?,71,[set()]
dothraki man,Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.,71,[set()]
jon snow,What's the matter?,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,The dragons are barely eating.,71,[set()]
jon snow,What's wrong with them?,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,They don't like the North.,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Go on.,71,[set()]
jon snow,I don't know how to ride a dragon.,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.,71,"[set(), set()]"

daenerys targaryen,"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.",71,[{'jon'}]
jon snow,What do I hold onto?,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Whatever you can.,71,[set()]
jon snow,You've completely ruined horses for me.,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,We could stay a thousand years-,71,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,No one would find us.,71,[set()]
jon snow,We'd be pretty old.,71,[set()]
jon snow,It's cold up here for a southern girl.,71,[set()]

arya stark,Can you make it?,71,[set()]
gendry baratheon,What do you need something like this for?,71,[set()]
arya stark,Can you make it or not?,71,[set()]
gendry baratheon,You already have a sword. What's that?,71,"[set(), set()]"

sansa stark,The King in the North.,71,[{'the'}]
jon snow,I told you we needed allies.,71,[set()]
sansa stark,You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.,71,[set()]

sansa stark,And a Targaryen queen.,71,[{'targaryen'}]
jon snow,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.",71,"[set(), {'sansa'}, set(), set(), set()]"

varys,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.",75,"[set(), {'targaryen'}]"
jon snow,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.,75,[set()]
varys,We both know what she's about to do.,75,[set()]
jon snow,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.,75,"[set(), set()]"
varys,"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.",75,[set()]
jon snow,What do you want?,75,[set()]
varys,All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.,75,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I don't want it. I never have.,75,"[set(), set()]"
varys,"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true",75,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,She is my queen.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Your Grace?,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,There's something you need to know.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Someone has betrayed me.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Yes.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow.,75,[{'jon'}]
tyrion lannister,Varys.,75,[{'varys'}]
daenerys targaryen,He knows the truth about Jon.,75,[{'jon'}]
tyrion lannister,He does.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.",75,"[set(), {'sansa'}, {'jon'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.,75,"[{'sansa'}, set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,And Varys?,75,[{'varys'}]
tyrion lannister,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.,75,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,It was a mistake.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?,75,"[{'sansa'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,She trusts me.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.",75,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.",75,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,But it doesn't matter now.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,No. It doesn't matter now.,75,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,It was me.,75,[set()]
varys,"I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.",75,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...",75,"[{'varys'}, {'targaryen'}]"
daenerys targaryen,sentence you to die. Dracarys.,75,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.,75,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.",75,"[{'torgo'}, set()]"
daenerys targaryen,What did I say would happen if you told your sister?,75,[set()]
jon snow,"I don't want it, and that's what I told him.",75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.,75,"[set(), {'varys'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I love you. And you will always be my queen.,75,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Is that all I am to you? Your queen?,75,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"All right, then.",75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,Let it be fear.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.",75,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.",75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.,75,"[set(), {'cersei'}, set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?,75,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.,75,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.,75,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"I beg you, my queen-",75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.,75,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies.",75,"[{'ready'}, set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.",75,"[{'cersei'}, set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.,75,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.,75,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.,75,"[set(), set()]"
guard,Let them pass.,75,[set()]
guard,Through the gate.,75,[set()]
guard,Get going.,75,[set()]
davos,The rearguard should be here by daybreak.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,She wants to attack now.,75,[set()]
jon snow,Daybreak at the earliest.,75,[set()]

soldier,My lord.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?",75,"[{'davos'}, set(), set()]"
davos,"I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?",75,[set()]
soldier,He's always better when he's got some food in him.,75,[set()]
soldier,Problem is when he's got drink in him. See what he did the other week?,75,"[set(), set()]"
soldier,Aye. Fighting as well. Commander nearly caught him.,75,"[set(), set(), set()]"
soldier,Ay up. Where you going?,75,"[set(), set()]"
arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.,75,"[{'arya'}, {'cersei'}]"
sandor clegane,"Think about it. She kills Cersei, the war's over. There won't be a siege. You might not even die tomorrow.",75,"[set(), {'cersei'}, set(), set()]"
soldier,I need to go talk to my captain.,75,[set()]
sandor clegane,"Go ahead, talk to him.",75,[set()]
soldier,Where's he going?,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I drink to eat the skull keeper.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I want to eat the skull keeper.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I want to see the ...,75,[set()]
unsullied,We speak the common tongue.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.,75,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
unsullied,We have orders to guard the prisoner.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?,75,"[set(), set()]"
unsullied,No.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.",75,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,How did they find you?,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Did you consider taking it off?,75,[set()]
jaime lannister,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister.""",75,"[{'cersei', 'lannister'}]"
tyrion lannister,"And you're going back to her, to die with her.",75,[set()]
jaime lannister,You've underestimated her before.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.,75,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Difficult to do from here.,75,[set()]
jaime lannister,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?,75,[{'cersei'}]
tyrion lannister,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.",75,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.",75,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.,75,"[set(), set(), {'cersei'}, set()]"
jaime lannister,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.",75,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.",75,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.,75,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,The city will fall tomorrow.,75,[set()]
jaime lannister,"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-",75,[{'lannister'}]
tyrion lannister,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.,75,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.",75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Why?,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.",75,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-,75,"[set(), {'cersei'}]"
tyrion lannister,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.",75,"[set(), set(), {'cersei'}]"
tyrion lannister,Swear to me.,75,[set()]
jaime lannister,You have my word.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.",75,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,I'll try.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.",75,"[set(), set()]"
jaime lannister,Your queen will execute you for this.,75,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.",75,[{'daenerys'}]
tyrion lannister,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood.",75,"[set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?",76,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.",76,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.,76,"[set(), {'varys'}, set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.",76,"[set(), set(), {'tywin'}]"
tyrion lannister,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.",76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,Cersei left her no choice.,76,[{'cersei'}]
tyrion lannister,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.",76,[set()]
jon snow,She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.,76,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,And she burned down a city for it.,76,[set()]
jon snow,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.",76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Would you have done it?,76,[set()]
jon snow,What?,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?",76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,I don't know.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.",76,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,What's it matter what I'd do?,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.",76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.,76,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,Love is the death of duty.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,You just came up with that?,76,[set()]
jon snow,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.,76,[{'aemon'}]
tyrion lannister,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?,76,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,That's her decision. She is the queen.,76,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,I'm sorry it came to this.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?,76,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.,76,"[{'sansa'}, {'dany'}]"
jon snow,She doesn't get to choose.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.",76,"[{'aegon'}, set(), set(), {'aegon'}]"
jon snow,I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.,76,"[{'lannister'}, set()]"
daenerys targaryen,It was necessary.,76,[set()]
jon snow,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.,76,"[{'cersei'}, set(), set()]"
jon snow,And Tyrion?,76,[{'tyrion'}]
daenerys targaryen,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?",76,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,Forgive him.,76,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,I can't.,76,[set()]
jon snow,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.",76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,"Please, Dany.",76,[{'dany'}]
daenerys targaryen,We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.,76,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.,76,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?,76,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,Because I know what is good. And so do you.,76,"[set(), set()]"
jon snow,I don't.,76,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,You do. You do. You've always known.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.,76,"[set(), set()]"
daenerys targaryen,They don't get to choose.,76,[set()]
daenerys targaryen,"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together.",76,"[set(), set(), set(), {'a'}, set(), set()]"
jon snow,"You are my queen. Now, and always.",76,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Where's Jon?,76,[{'jon'}]
grey worm,He is our prisoner.,76,[set()]
sansa stark,So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.,76,"[{'tyrion'}, set()]"
grey worm,We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.,76,"[set(), set()]"
sansa stark,"If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.",76,[{'jon'}]
grey worm,And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.,76,[set()]
yara greyjoy,Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.,76,"[set(), set(), {'daenerys'}]"
sansa stark,You swore to follow a tyrant.,76,[set()]
yara greyjoy,"She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves.",76,"[set(), {'jon', 'cersei'}, set()]"
arya stark,Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.,76,[set()]
davos,"Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?",76,"[set(), set(), {'torgo'}, set()]"
davos,"If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
grey worm,We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.,76,"[set(), set(), {'jon'}]"
tyrion lannister,It's not for you to decide.,76,[set()]
grey worm,You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.,76,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.,76,"[set(), set(), set(), {'jon'}, set(), set()]"
maester wolkan,We don't have a king or queen.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.,76,"[set(), set()]"
grey worm,"Make your choice, then.",76,[set()]
edmure,My lords and ladies. I suppose this is the most important moment of our lives. What we decide today will reverberate through the annals of history. I stand before you as one of the senior lords in the country. A veteran of two wars. And I like to think my experience has led to some small skill in statecraft - and underst-,76,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Uncle? Please sit.,76,"[set(), set()]"
maester wolkan,"Well, we have to choose someone.",76,[set()]
sam,Why just us?,76,[set()]
sam,"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.",76,"[set(), set()]"
edmure,Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.,76,[set()]
yohn royce,I'll ask my horse.,76,[set()]
edmure,I suppose you want the crown.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Me? The Imp?,76,"[set(), {'the'}]"
tyrion lannister,"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.",76,[{'daenerys'}]
tyrion lannister,Can't think of a worse choice.,76,[set()]
davos,"Who, then?",76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'bran'}, set(), set(), {'the'}, set(), set(), set(), set()]"
sansa stark,Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.,76,[{'bran'}]
tyrion lannister,"Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.",76,"[set(), set()]"
tyrion lannister,"I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?",76,"[set(), set(), set(), set()]"
bran stark,Why do you think I came all this way?,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.,76,"[{'brandon'}, set()]"

brienne,Aye.,76,[set()]
sansa stark,"I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros.

bran stark,And I don't want to be king.,76,[set()]

bran stark,He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
grey worm,It is not enough.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.,76,"[set(), set(), set()]"
jon snow,There's still a Night's Watch?,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.",76,"[set(), {'grey'}, {'sansa', 'arya'}, set(), set()]"

tyrion lannister,What we did.,76,[set()]
jon snow,It doesn't feel right.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,Ask me again in ten years.,76,[set()]
jon snow,I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.,76,[set()]
tyrion lannister,I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.,76,"[set(), set()]"
unsullied captain,All the men have boarded.,76,[set()]
grey worm,Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.,76,"[set(), set()]"
